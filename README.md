# reddit-toxicity-triggers


This project explores the triggers of toxic conversations on Reddit by analyzing comment-level toxicity across Indian. We use the [Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/) to assess toxicity levels and aim to uncover social interaction patterns that escalate toxicity.

## Subreddits Analyzed

- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India: `india`, `IndiaSpeaks`, `librandu`, etc.

##  Goals

- Identify toxicity triggers across cultural contexts
- Visualize toxicity trends across subreddits
- Construct interaction graphs from comments
- (Upcoming) Train models to detect or predict toxic escalation

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-toxicity-triggers.git
