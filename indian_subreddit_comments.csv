Despite some cultural differences, we've connected on so many levels. The only thing I'm having an issue with is how she sometimes treats her friends.

I know women can be hard to befriend in a new place and most of the people in her program are men anyways, so it's who she is exposed to. Recently, she met an Indian guy we'll call Raj (23) and he seems cool. My problem is, I've hung out with her, Raj and some other friends, and last night felt odd. She drank a little too much, but even before the drinking, she seemed a bit over affectionate. She often hugs him (which is fine to me) but she'll hold his hand, and last night when we were dancing, they'd hold hands, have their arms around a shoulder, dance close, and his hands frequently ended up everywhere on her body. I know everyone had been drinking, but near the end, his hand landed on her boob. That's where I stepped in and politely put some space between them.

In general, she often seems a little flirty, or at least crude with her jokes, and I've mentioned this before when Raj had held her hand when we 3 went ice skating, which I wrote off as ""helping her to stay balanced"" because she is new to it. The other part is, when they first met, he very much had a crush on her. She immediately informed her she wouldn't be interested and had a boyfriend, but it feels like to me, he's testing his boundaries and she blows it off as being friendly.

I've always been fascinated by animals and especially the wild animals you can see everywhere in India. Unfortunately my family in particular discourages this interest, they tend to take fear and caution to an extreme level. For instance, I frequently pet cows, buffalo and goats and have never had any truly bad experiences with them. Even if annoyed they'll usually just lightly headbutt me or aggressively swing their head/shake a little.

I am curious about other animals though. I tend to stay away from dogs unless someone can vouch for them, because that's a rabies or other disease risk. I also wouldn't try to pet pigs because they can often roll around in filth. I do pet cats, though most of them run away from me.

I've never run into elephants, and I'm not foolish enough to attempt any kind of friendly interaction with tigers or leopards. I don't mess around with snakes or lizards either because I don't know which ones will be venomous and/or poisonous.

What animals are generally safe to engage with? And another thing I've been curious about are monkeys like langurs which are common in parts of Kolkata I frequent while I'm there.

I'm living in Delhi and earns about 63000 a month. Please suggest how can I save maximum money. Here's my fixed expenses: 

Rent - 15000
Car loan - 12500
Electricity bill - 2500 (Summers else zero bill in winters)
Fuel expenses - 2000 (Maximum)
SIP - 4000

Total - 36000
Money Left - 63000 - 36000 = 27000

I am thinking about saving 13-14k and survive the rest of the month in the remaining amount.

I don't drink! I don't smoke! Don't have any big spending habits. I also don't go out much (2-3 times a month maximum)

So a little backstory - So there's this girl I love and planning to meet her family by the mid/end of this year (Sep-Oct). We both agreed on this that we will let our family know by Sep-Oct. 
Till now I have never thought about saving the money but now, we are planning to get married by the first half of next year and that is why I'm genuinely afraid. 
I'm now sinking into a guilt that I should have saved some money years back! 

Out of those 63000 which I earn every month, I usually spend all of this by the end of the month. The only investment I have is one SIP of 4k a month and one lump sump investment of 50k in mid cap Mutual fund.

I know, I know I should have saved enough money or atleast have some amount in my bank but I think it's never too late. If I start now, I can save some amount by the end of this year.

I am also planning to change my Job so that I can atleast get a decent hike and have more savings potential.

I would seriously need some advice how to manage my finances! What can I do to increase my savings. I don't want to stop my SIP's either. Please suggest some steps.",1,1743422318.0,False

I wish I was content and happy with life but I'm neither. I've taken bad decisions in life and have been unfortunate enough as well, but all I yearn for is for a moment of respite and a life that I can be happy living. 

I lost my job in October 2023. I was working in a startup and I worked for 10-13 hours a day, 6-7 days a week and just like that, I was laid off. The company was running out of funds and because they were never able to find a fixed role for me, I was let go. 

I wish I gave a piece of my mind to my employers but I didn't- all because I wanted to be done with that place as peacefully as possible. 

I sought a bit of break for 3 months, because quite frankly- I was burnt out. Alongside all the stress at work, I've had a long battle with depression. 

Following the break,  I applied earnestly to several roles based on my skills(operations, google sheets/excel and sql) and marketing (because I've a keen interest in pursuing a career in marketing) but to absolutely no avail. I reached out to people on linked-in, I applied to hundreds of places via linked-in and I could only get two interviews- I was rejected after both) 6 months since my last role and I could only get two interviews. I reached out to my previous company's HR for help, but they ghosted me as well. For 3 more months, I tried- hoping to find an opportunity and yet it didn't lead to anything. Gave several aptitude exams for roles- only to be told they're looking for engineers or that my profile was not of their liking. For much of this duration, I was ready to work for half of my previous pay and as an intern as well but for naught). 

After an year of a desperate search for suitable roles and a horrible mental state, I gave up on job search and shifted my focus towards management entrance exams. I worked hard for it, did my best and fell short. Was able to get calls from a few private business schools, but as luck would have it- had horrible interviewers for two non-CAT private business schools based in Mumbai and Pune, respectively and couldn't convert those. I was able to convert the other Pune business school, thankfully- which remains the only option for me. 

Which fuels another concern- rebuilding a career after a significant gap. I've heard that business school's placement committees flag profiles with a huge gap and push them further down the pile. Companies, themselves do not want people with a significant gap in their profile. 

These two factors, alone have absolutely compounded my misery. I have lost hope that I'll be able to get a good role from my college placements. Irrespective of all the upskilling, all the networking that I do, that career gap will be there like a blot on my profile and will hinder companies to even consider me. 

All that has happened in the last 20 months or so, that has defined the last 24 years of my life, and perhaps the next 25 years of my life, as well. I absolutely abhor this situation that I am in and really wish there was a way out. The last 20 months of my life have made me question my existence and my worth. 

Please, consider this as an SOS, and please tell me what do I do in my MBA to ensure that this gap is not seen as a blot. I do not want to live like a failure anymore. Please help.",2,1742126348.0,False

I‚Äôve spent most of my life trying to be the person my family wanted me to be. I never even wanted to study architecture, but I did it because it was my father‚Äôs dream. I pushed through, studied, worked, and even opened my own office. But no matter what I do, it‚Äôs never enough. They‚Äôve told me multiple times that I‚Äôm not cut out for this field, that I lack the capability. My own family questions my worth, my ability.

For two years, I didn‚Äôt work a traditional job, but I wasn‚Äôt sitting idle either. I handled responsibilities nobody saw‚Äîdealing with court cases, making sure my family wasn‚Äôt stressed, standing by them through everything. I was there when my father had a hernia, when he got COVID, and when a heart attack followed. I took care of things without ever making them feel like a burden. And still, I get told that I‚Äôve done nothing.

I lost ‚Çπ25,000 in trading, and instead of seeing it as a lesson, my father sees it as proof that I‚Äôm a failure. Every decision I make, every step I take, is questioned. There‚Äôs always something I didn‚Äôt do right. Every time I try to stand up, life knocks me back down.

I have struggled with anxiety for years. I had dizziness episodes while working in Pune, to the point where I thought something was seriously wrong with me. I‚Äôve had heart palpitations, chest pain, and every symptom that made me think I was dying. But it was just anxiety, just my mind eating me alive.

I‚Äôve been through narcissistic parenting. That‚Äôs something I realized in therapy. The constant control, the guilt-tripping, the need to prove my worth over and over again‚Äîit messes with you. It makes you question yourself even when you know you‚Äôre doing the right thing. It drains you.

I had a relationship in the past that messed me up. I cared deeply, but it ended, and she moved on. I told another girl I had feelings for her, only to be met with silence for months before a simple ‚Äúsorry, I don‚Äôt want to bother.‚Äù And that was it. No closure, no nothing. Just left hanging. Now, I don‚Äôt even know if I want to open up to someone again. And maybe it‚Äôs stupid, but I never went around looking for distractions. I‚Äôm still a virgin, not because of some moral choice, but because I always believed in love, in something real. But all I‚Äôve gotten in return is heartbreak and disappointment.

And no, I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt get high to cope. But I still fell into the most destructive habit of them all‚Äîone that wrecked me physically and mentally. Masturbation became my escape, my crutch, my self-punishment. I‚Äôve done it thousands of times in my life, and I can feel how it has drained me. And I hate it, but it became the only thing I had control over.

I know people have had worse lives. I know I should be grateful. But I just feel exhausted. At 26, I should feel like I‚Äôm building something, like I have a purpose. Instead, I feel like I‚Äôm standing in the ruins of something I never even wanted to build in the first place.

Delhi was my soul city, until now.

Its always depressing. I shifted to Delhi in 2017. 


In 2022, I ( 27F) met my current boyfriend( 30M) and for the past 1 year we have been living together as well. Some background, we belong to different communities. He is a brahmin, marwari from Rajasthan and I am a baniya from Bihar. Now coming back to the story, my boyfriend is getting married. Not to me. To someone else. Its an arrange marriage with a girl from the same community. He wont marry me because we are from two different castes( in India, caste is the deciding factor) for most people. 

His roka is on 6th April. I have negative thoughts of killing myself in 15 different ways. We still live together because I cant let go. I don‚Äôt think i am emotionally or physically healthy enough to let go. He says he is also attached and misses me when i am away but wont marry me due to caste. I dont think he has even mentioned about me in his family. I hate him and love him at the same time. 

His fianc√©e, well the girl( 28F) has no parents. Her parents passed away in covid. Looks really simple and sweet to me. She comes from a small village in Rajasthan and is really quiet. They do not really chat or talk over call because she is from an orthodox family. I have stalked her Instagram too many times. I want to tell her everything but i cant because he will hate me. I don‚Äôt want that, i don‚Äôt think i can process that. I have such guilt. Its so wrong. She does not deserve this. She has no parents. No siblings. Lives with her old aunt. I can‚Äôt even express my jealously without feeling guilt. This is so wrong.

He was engaged last year in August as well but the engagement broke in September as the girl felt he was not the one. So i know exactly what to expect, that one month was horrible. I used to cry all the time. Couldn‚Äôt eat. Couldn‚Äôt sleep. Lost weight. Was in numerous counselling sessions for anxiety and depression. 

He says they will probably get married in November/ December and that we will be together until then and then no contact. In some perverse way, I want to spend all my time with him. I don‚Äôt
 want to let him go. I get such anxiety when he is not there. There is too much emotional dependency. I do not think I can tolerate the distance. 

I have no clue how i am going to handle the breakup once it happens. I feel like puking and killing myself just at the thought of it. I am so afraid.

= Next day on monday we obv had a fight about it and he pushed me so hard that i fell on ground near staircase. He ran off like a pussy and didn't came to office for a week ( what a peaceful week it wasüò≠)
= He was constantly threatening me do something or other or he'll call my father. Like he just wanted to control me. He use to check my phone all the times with this threat.
= He used to follow me to my house after office. At this point i just don't feel safe around him.
= He actually told my father but not the truth a twisted version. That i have a bf and had sex with him and he was sooo innocent and he just likes me and did nothing wrong. 
I actually came in contact with my ex let's call him X and eventually i told X everything and it was our plan to say that we're together now (me and X ) and you ( L)¬†¬†should leave me alone. 
You get the idea. Now for the advice part.
I've already told our sir about everything. 
I wanted to call his father and tell him everything but the problem is, L's elder brother knows everything. He and his brother are so same. Imagine how the father will be. He's not scared of his father. So i don't think his father can do anything and it'll make my situation even worse. What he got angry again. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT TO DO",1,1743599708.0,False

The last two years, 2023-24, have been very brutal.

The worst feeling is knowing they don‚Äôt even realize or seem to care about how much I sacrificed.

To whoever is reading this: PLEASE, NEVER EVER prioritize a dysfunctional family over yourself.

I‚Äôve made peace with my parents and forgiven them, for the most part. The situation still escalates sometimes, but at least now I‚Äôm able to get over it within a day or a week.

However, it‚Äôs still hard to get over what my younger brother did over the last two years. I know for sure that things will never be the same again and honestly, I‚Äôm not even interested anymore after everything that happened. As someone said, ""The opposite of love is not hate, it‚Äôs indifference."" But even with all that, it‚Äôs still hard to move on, especially after all the sacrifices I made over the years.

What I really meant by the ""moving on"" part is that, after everything fell apart in the last two years, I can't stop thinking that I wasted the better part of my life on a dysfunctional family and now my personal life is a mess with real consequences. I have no clue how to turn it around.

Make your own Goals first and focus on them. Simple goals. 

Remember why you joined this college: to get your master‚Äôs degree and build your future.

Try to see this as a temporary challenge that you need to overcome

Find a support system outside college. Or if your batch does not seem fit, try to connect with seniors. I am sure someone is matching your frequency and has gone through, or is going through what you are going through 

Since there are no extracurricular activities, create your own! Learn new skills online, work on personal projects, or start something that makes you feel good

Don‚Äôt let gossip and selfishness affect your self-worth and maintain emotional distance from negativity. To avoid the politics of any space, being neutral can help you avoid unnecessary stress.

Don't worry this ""monopoly power abuse"" is the reason our economy is in the shape it is. 

For eg. If the govt didnt really act so ""touchy touchy"" in the age of ai (sigh!), they can in fact get stand-up to be something of an economy in itself. And the idea to get more money generated (even as tax) through these things (events and such) IS THE WAY A HEALTHY ECONOMY WORKS. But since you've given the gov. too much of a consent to have you grabbed by the balls, and jerk the mone...sorry tax...out of y'all anytime...why would they wanna really build an economy? Lol.

I have clothes to wash, my bike is dirty. I haven't taken a bath in 2 days. 
While some rich people and govt. officers and local politicians get 24x7 water supply in their private residences, not far from my place. My parents are kinda wealthy and kinda influencial but they don't bribe or ask for favours, so we're suffering like everybody else. Which is not a bad thing. I wouldn't want it any other way. 
But, as soon as I posted that video on facebook my parents called me and forced me to delete it. Saying that ""faltu me in logo se panga mat le, in logo se koi panga nahi leta, humara jeena haram kar denge"".
I'm not scared of these shits. I also have some friends at powerful places, but, like my parents I too don't want to get any favours. 
So, I deleted the video. 
I live in a small town where everybody knows everybody. But I hate the level of corruption there is. 

The mining officer here lets these people, the one's in my video, steal sand and stones from the river shores. They have a mafia of sorts, and that's how they became wealthy. So one day I also made a video of them illegally mining and showed it to the mining officer who visits me for business every once in a while. And he told the thieves about it and thieves owed me some money as well. So they never paid off their debt.

Our town also has local news channels on YT and FB. All do do is lick ass. I sent the video to them as well, no response. But my sibling is a govt. officer as well so the local reporters instead started harrassing her and reported on her ""incompetence"" from time to time, they basically targeted her. So she got herself a transfer and moved away from this bullshit. 

India is an extremely corrupt country, down to smallest towns and villages. The entire system helps the corrupt and I can't just blame the system. The people are corrupt as well. I'd say 90% of the people are corrupt. What's the point in fighting if none is going to assist you?",3,1743920493.0,False

The only way it changes is with action, & collaboration consistently


Switch over to Bluesky, Lem my (Voyager for Lem my app), Revolt, Matrix (Element app), Flashes, & Spark (Last one isn't out yet)


The only way government changes to enable people is if all people are working together coordinated to change the government to actually serve the people by having the people in it


Same thing that for Run For Something organization does. Every country needs organizations like that getting younger people who actually care into office


1. Unite on online platforms with your people

india,1jsksen,Hindustan Times: President Droupadi Murmu signs Waqf (Amendment) bill 2025 into law,mlnskju,t3_1jsksen,Mobile-Decision-4353,"
Why Muslims Are Opposing the Waqf Bill

	1.	Loss of Control Over Waqf Properties
	‚Ä¢	The bill allows non-Muslims to be appointed to the Central and State Waqf Boards, which traditionally are meant to manage Muslim charitable endowments.
	‚Ä¢	Many Muslims see this as undermining the religious nature of waqf and diluting Muslim representation in institutions specifically created for their community.
	2.	End of ‚ÄúWaqf by User‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	This clause allowed properties to be considered waqf if they were used for religious or charitable purposes over a long time, even if no formal deed existed.
	‚Ä¢	The bill proposes removing this, which could potentially make thousands of mosques, graveyards, and madrasas vulnerable to legal disputes‚Äîespecially those built centuries ago without formal documentation.
	3.	Government Overreach
	‚Ä¢	The decision-making power over whether a property is waqf now lies with government officers instead of an independent Waqf Tribunal.
	‚Ä¢	Critics argue this creates a conflict of interest and opens the door for the state to deny waqf status to contested properties.
	4.	Encroachment and Evictions
	‚Ä¢	Instead of strengthening existing eviction laws (like the 2014 bill proposed by former Minority Affairs Minister K Rahman Khan), the current government seeks to implement sweeping reforms that could result in loss of community control, rather than focusing on protecting waqf lands from illegal encroachments.
	5.	Undermining Constitutional Rights
	‚Ä¢	Legal experts and Muslim leaders claim the bill could violate Articles 25 to 30 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantee religious freedom and protection of minority institutions.
	6.	Fear of State Takeover
	‚Ä¢	Muslims fear that with increased government control, there might be a gradual attempt to nationalize or repurpose waqf properties under the pretext of ‚Äútransparency‚Äù and ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù(aljazeera.com).com](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/12/6/waqf-bill-why-indian-muslims-worry-about-modi-plan-for-14bn-endowments))(indiatoday.in)y.in](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/waqf-amendment-bill-parliament-controversial-provisions-explained-2702387-2025-04-01))(en.islamonweb.net)nweb.net](https://en.islamonweb.net/waqf-board-amendment-bill-2024-controversies-and-concerns-of-the-muslim-community))(businessconnectindia.in)onnectindia.in](https://businessconnectindia.in/waqf-bill-controversy-explained/)).

Misinformation Spread by Groups

	1.	‚ÄúWaqf is Grabbing Government Land‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Right-wing narratives often claim that the waqf board is illegally declaring public or private land as waqf. However, waqf claims typically go through legal scrutiny, and many such properties were donated centuries ago but lack paperwork.
	2.	‚ÄúMuslims Control 9 lakh acres of Indian land‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	While it‚Äôs true that Waqf Boards manage significant property, these are endowments for religious or social welfare, not private Muslim ownership. The land is not for individual benefit but meant for public religious or charitable use.
	3.	‚ÄúWaqf Boards Are Corrupt So Must Be Dissolved‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	While mismanagement exists, as with many institutions, critics argue that reforming governance within the boards is the solution‚Äînot handing control over to government officers or altering its communal nature.
	4.	‚ÄúMosques and Graveyards Are Not at Risk‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	This is contradicted by the removal of the ‚Äúwaqf by user‚Äù clause. Since many mosques and graveyards have no paperwork but have been in use for generations, they could be vulnerable under the new law.

In summary, Muslims are not opposing reform, but they want reforms that preserve the religious autonomy of waqf institutions and ensure community control, not government dominance. The bill is seen as part of a broader pattern of marginalizing Muslim institutions, especially when there is no Muslim representation in the current NDA cabinet, a first in independent India‚Äôs history(en.islamonweb.net)nweb.net](https://en.islamonweb.net/waqf-board-amendment-bill-2024-controversies-and-concerns-of-the-muslim-community)).",9,1743920017.0,False

There was a small patch of land adjacent to our house. One day, someone threw a poly bag filled with garbage. Soon, more people followed and it became a dump. We would stop people when we could. But it was impossible to monitor it all the time. We hung a signboard made in Hindi and English requesting people not to dump trash. It didn't stop.

Then, we had it enough. My father, brother, and I made it a mission to stop the garbage dump. We had the spot cleaned and then we took turns to watch the spot. My father used to get up at 4 am. I'd watch it till 11 pm. We would stop people and then force them to pick up not only their garbage but also some extra garbage that they didn't throw. I called it return gift.

The reason India is dirty is the municipalities garbage collection is not in the same proportion as garbage production from poor and low socio economic sections. If the municipality of a city undertook garbage collection 5 times in 24 hours, hired 4 times as many garbage department workers, installed dustbins at most locations, undertook education campaigns on loudspeakers, and then fined anyone littering at a place where already garbage bins are, the entire city would get cleaned up.


Most people talking about this blame Indians for their lack of civic sense. It is true that Indians have a lack of civic sense and litter everywhere.¬† But a poor population isn't magically going to collectively start learning civic sense. The drive has to be started from the government organization responsible which in this case are the municipalities.¬†


I have seen municipalities installing garbage bins only for them to be overflown with garbage and all the garbage being then thrown on the street beside the bins because garbage is only collected once and the generation is perhaps 5 tines as much. What are poor people supposed to do?¬†


If there was adequate infrastructure (bins, recycle plants, sufficient landfills,¬† incinerators, workers), and all efforts were made to educate people, then of course the final step is to fine people. If all these was done by the govt, our garbage problem would disappear in a few years.


The buck stops with the govt. The municipalities are only interested in collecting taxes, the babus are privileged brats, the workers not enough and not paid enough and no evaluation system exists, and no infrastructure is being invested in or developed.

But I went through your posts and most of the articles and some other info on this subject (didn't see most of the videos though), didn't have a strong opinion on this topic before but reading through your posts suprisingly I am now strongly in support of the bill, in fact it seems that it falls far short. I am sure BJP had ulterior motives in bring this bill.  Your write up sounds completely dishosnest to me.

The way I see the main issue here is not about religion, but of property law. If and where any of these apply to other religious boards, my stand remains same for them too

You title your post One Nation, Two Standards but doesn't the existence of Waqf Board itself do that? Why can't religious trusts use a common law? Will you support if other religions can use the same laws and tax structures as waqf or vice versa?

Very clearly there is a problem with the way things are and perhaps this bill is not the right way to reform the system, but the people who are opposing this bill seem to not provide any other alternative reforms of their own. The dominant argument is that this bill is unconstitutional, but how? You can't just throw that word around. They already established they want different laws for different religions.

> The claim about Tiruchendurai temple is interesting because the Waqf board does not claim the temple or the village. According to the records, Queen Rani Mangammal had made several donations to Waqf, and it was documented in the government's own record from 1954.
> Waqf Board head refutes Centre's claim over 1,500-year-old 'Hindu village'

The headline says it does not claim, the article says it does! It is not the entire village, just 50-60% of the village including the temple. Wah! The guy even goes on to **mention some other villages and centures old temples belong to them.**

It seems a non-muslim can donate to a waqf (until this latest bill), and can be a beneficiary of it, and the waqf does not have to be used for religious purposes. Waqf property also seems to contain many temples being actively used even! If so why is it necessary that the board members be muslim? Also I might be wrong in this case, but religion of an employee should only be considered if he primarily deals with religious affairs. And in any case there should be auditory and supervisory roles which should not discriminate on basis of religion (which i believe is the case for many temple boards).  

Waqf by use seems to be an absolute joke. Just because some place is being used for some religious purpose (even if it is a mosque or graveyard), does not mean it was given away as wakf. It doesn't even necessarily have to mean ownership of the land. Clearly wakf board does not recognize continuous usage of land by the temples for centuries as proof of ownership, but same rules don't apply for them? And just because some ruler donated property to some muslim doesn't mean it was wakf

Regarding the fact that only a practicing muslim can now donate, some of the opposition have rightfully pointed out that the state cannot properly determine who is a practicing muslim and who is not. But isn't this the same for the board members? Does he need to pray 5 times a day, do zakat, support niqab? Does he need to belong to a particular sect? Is an ahmadiyya a muslim? What if the person who originally donated the property disagrees with this interpretation of islam? Of if someone wants to waqf his land, but doesn't like the waqf boards handling of things?

A property can be be given to waqf, but it cannot then be brought out of it? Does any other entity have such privilege? If the property especially land is being misused or neglected or otherwise is needed for some important public use then the government should be able to repurpose them similar to other land. Land should be subject to same laws and taxes regardless of who owns it. 

Perpetual trusts should not exist in any sensible legal framework.  

You bring up sachar committee report, but that is from 2006! long before the 2013 amendment which seems to be the main culprit. I didn't find any source for the 7% claim, but then also how many of lands claimed by wakf are illegally snatched by them? Why do you assume for lands under litigation wakf is on the right side?  


> Additionally, in earlier days, the registration or ownership of land was not properly verified before donation. The same problem was found in the land donated in thee Bhoodan movement.

> Many people do not have proper documents of their private property. This was again highlighted during the recent land survey in Bihar, which has resulted in huge disputes.

So if wakf board lays a claim on a land is being for used by somebody since a long time. Wakf board doesn't have to produce the documents it's difficult. But the person who actually has proof of possession needs to provide the proof?

A couple of days ago I scolded an unsupervised child for kicking and stepping on a puppy's head.

Soon enough that tiny fucker would either be attacked by the parent of that pup, or that pup if gets vengeful, can easily give a nasty bite.

I won't be blaming the pup or any dog for biting that child. And this isn't an isolated case. There are many fuckers who find out what happens after you fuck around, but then play the victim.

I'll just suggest to keep the kids either under supervision or on a leash. Because these nasty fuckers grow up and then become the worst of society.

I hope me scolding the child keeps him away from trouble and he realises that the dogs can do much worse to him than what he cam do to them right now. And hopefully he grows into a better person. Right now he's a trashy human for sure.

india,1jrwlz1,Stray dogs kill 30 Deers Every Year At University of Hyderabad campus-Times of India,mll2gg9,t1_mlil4ay,tea_snob10,"Again with this whole ""explain statistics to me"" crowd. Fatality rates for wild animals are globally expressed as a percentage of encounters (sometimes per capita). Let me help you by illustrating:

India has an estimated 70 million stray dogs (62 million in 2021) and has a human population of 1.4 billion. The daily encounter rate per stray dog per person, is therefore fairly high, which is fundamentally obvious, considering the largest human population in the world, and the largest stray dog population in the world are sharing the exact same space. 

So if we consider a fairly conservative figure of each stray dog encountering at least 10 people a day (crossing their paths; sitting near them, hanging around in close proxy), then this puts the daily encounter at 700 million, which is actually a fairly lowball figure, but basically means at least half the country crosses paths with at least 1 stray dog per day, which is easily believable (reality would be higher).

We then multiply the per day encounter rate by 365 to get us the annual stray dog encounter rate for Indians in India, and you get 255.5 billion times. Again, quite the lowball cause it should be higher but let's roll with it. 

Now let's get to the nitty gritty; there were 2.2 million dog-bites in 2024, and in its worst year, had an estimated 20,000 fatalities mostly due to rabid dogs. When we contextualize the numbers, the bite-rate returns 1/116,136 which is just 0.00086% and the death/fatality-rate is 1/12,775,000 (1 in 1.27 crore) or 0.0000078%. 

We call this the [Base Rate Fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy) and is a common fallacy globally when numbers (often thrown out by mainstream media) are not contextualized therefore leading to poorly drawn inferences often tied with [appeal to emotion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion) to drive clicks.

Stop this bullshit. There are many instances where dogs attack without any provocation. Many kids are mauled to death without any provocation. Do you think toddlers harass dogs? Then why do they attack them? It's because it's in their nature. And well fed dogs do run behind bikes, which can lead to serious injury.

Leave stray, why do well fed and well taken care of dogs (pets) attack others? Why are they aggressive?

Dogs are wolves descendants. They become more aggressive when they are in a pack.

It was like any other land dispute that go on for years. Once the legal position was clarified, if it turned out that it was indeed Waqf property, then some understanding could be reached at the local level.

What BJP has changed 

1) Added a new layer of intervention by the executive in the form of a DM or similar-rank officer. He can veto Waqf board decisions without even sending them to Waqf tribunal. That is NOT putting civil court in charge, that is actually REMOVING civil court authority and giving to an officer of the executive, who as you know, are usually appointed on basis of loyalty to the political party in power. 

2) Remove Waqf by use claims so that BJP governments can grab any land which doesn't have proper documentation.

It's a lie to say ""these christians weren't protected.""

The tribunal was already doing its due process and it seems like it's more likely to go in benefit of the residents. The Kerala government itself had favoured the residents saying nobody will lose their land or houses and even overriding one of the Waqf board's decision earlier. The previous owner, Farooq College, itself had said it's no longer Waqf property because it had sold the residents the land. It had failed to [register those sales](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-politics/munambam-waqf-land-dispute-protests-christians-hindus-9668032/). Everybody other than the Waqf board was on the residents side. It was like any other property dispute - when a property is under dispute, you can't sell it until the dispute's been resolved.

The Waqf board too isn't some private reckless land grabbing body. They're appointed by government itself and they have a duty to protect Waqf lands. To the best of their knowledge, the land was still Waqf because the College had received it as Waqf and then failed to inform them of selling it to others. The tribunal would have likely ruled in favour of the residents. Even if it didn't, they had the right to appeal in high court and SC.

Here only one law is cherrypicked as militating against ""pure reason and fairness"" (as ""intuitively sensed"" by legal luminaries such as yourself). Only one law is cherrypicked as special treatment and unconstitutional. 

However, legal luminaries such as yourself don't say anything about other laws that include the same clauses. 

So a doubt arises whether jurisprudence philosophers (such as yourself) are really motivated by ""pure reason and fairness""? 
Or perhaps mindsets that are their exact opposites?

If the government is truly serious about uniformity, let‚Äôs not stop at personal laws. Let‚Äôs introduce a Uniform Religious Property Bill that brings all religious institutions - temples, churches, mutts, dargahs, gurdwaras - under a single, transparent legal framework. What's good for waqf must be good for all.  
  
Start by placing Hindu Temple Boards and Church Trusts under central regulation, just as waqf properties are now subjected to. Mandate that all temples, mathas, churches, and gurdwaras register their properties and financial records. These should be uploaded to a public digital portal, detailing not just landholdings, but also revenue from donations, land leases, trustee appointments, and how funds are spent.  
  
No trust or religious property should be allowed to operate in the shadows. The Right to Information (RTI) must apply uniformly. Why should a small waqf in a village face legal exposure while massive temple trusts in billion-dollar empires remain opaque?  
  
Let‚Äôs take it further. Many temples and churches - especially those in forests, hills, and cities - sit on public land or common property without formal deeds. Just like waqf-by-user is under the scanner, these too must be required to prove their legal title, or face action. No sacred cow exemptions.  
  
Also, let‚Äôs talk about representation. If non-Muslims are to sit on waqf boards, then surely it‚Äôs time to mandate at least two non-Hindus on Hindu temple boards, and non-Christians on Church Trusts. Inclusion is a two-way street, isn‚Äôt it?  
  
Apply land ceiling laws, urban land regulations, and property rules uniformly to all religious lands across faiths. And let‚Äôs audit all ‚Äúcommunity-used‚Äù religious sites, especially those claiming centuries-old use to evade modern land laws.  
  
Finally, priesthood and trust leadership must be accountable. If waqf CEOs can be removed by government oversight, why not extend the same logic to temple mahants, trust heads, and church administrators? Introduce performance audits, establish removal mechanisms, and hold them to financial and administrative standards. Religious leadership is not a hereditary fiefdom.  
  
We all know the truth, though: this won‚Äôt happen. Because the Uniform Civil Code, in its current form, isn‚Äôt about uniformity at all. It‚Äôs about selective standardisation, aimed squarely at one community, while others are left untouched.",1,1743922875.0,False

How the Government will defend this in the Court will be interesting to see.

Nothing  ""unparalleled"" at all. Same as other laws as described in my longer reply below. 

Also, Waqf tribunals ARE civil courts. They are headed by a bonafide judge!

From [section 83](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/84071258/):

> Every Tribunal shall consist of‚Äî

> (a)one person, who shall be **a member of the State Judicial Service holding a rank, not below that of a District, Sessions or Civil Judge, Class I**, who shall be the Chairman;

> (c) one person having knowledge of Muslim law and jurisprudence

The tribunals need not even have any Muslims at all. Just one person with knowledge of Muslim law. Of course, that's probably a Muslim usually. But they're just a member.

> The Tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court and shall have the same powers as may be exercised by a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure. Civil Courts were powerless to stop the land grab.

This isn't unique to Waqf Act either. See the other Hindu religious endowment acts I've linked below. Most of them follow the same structure with a tribunal or its equivalent with the power of district court to avoid redundancy at the lower judicial level. And then, all the acts allow tribunal rulings to be appealed in state HCs and SC.

> No appeal shall lie against any decision or order whether interim or otherwise, given or made by the Tribunal:Provided that a High Court may, on its own motion or on the application of the Board or any person aggrieved, call for and examine the records relating to any dispute, question or other matter which has been determined by the Tribunal for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of such determination and may confirm, reverse or modify such determination or pass such other order as it may think fit.

I'm not a lawyer but this argument sounds ridiculous to me given that in any property case the burden of proof is always on the litigants, not the government.

We‚Äôre so closed minded, so much so that, we don‚Äôt even realize how absurd we can be, it‚Äôs just baked into our national personality, we don't realize. And that might be one of the key reasons we continue to lag behind truly civilized societies. 

Now what‚Äôs this sudden hysteria about Empuraan? From what I‚Äôve seen, many reviewers are calling it a pretty average or even below average film. But forget that, our right wing can‚Äôt even handle comedians, and here they are getting worked up over a movie that probably doesn‚Äôt even come close to Parzania in depth or courage.

The truth is, every single one of us from each and every Indian state backed by every political flavor imaginable has at some point banned or opposed films. Why? Because we, as a nation, are just built like that. Outrage is our national pastime. We proudly push films medicority after mediocrity be it Ooonimool, Poothaan, Joowaan Poossphhee, Saaalaariee so many to ‚Çπ1000 crore clubs. But a film like Village Rockstars? It barely got noticed, let alone supported by the general public. Now, I'm not opposing the former, I'm saying, what's our priorities as general audience is. And we keep on peddling political propaganda films be it for left wing or right wing or liberal all kind of nonsense and self proclaim propoganda as ART HOUSE FILMS and never even know what works as a art house film too. Such jokers we all are.  

That tells you exactly where our collective intelligence, taste, maturity, and political sanity stands and how all these bans are just really have no LOGICAL or RATIONAL sensibilities. Simply because we are just doing what comforts our stupidity for ages and will keep on doing it.

And yet, we keep chanting the mantra of ""developing India"" with a political class that‚Äôs barely evolved from medieval thinking, and with voters (us!) who queue up religiously to put them in power. Or better yet, we migrate abroad and start claiming we‚Äôre the greatest contributors to other countries now.

Honestly? The joke's on us. :-D And think of these list of films being banned or had issues to be released too.

First of all, think for a second what this will entail, if you genuinely want to succeed, you need to be patient and be willing to work really hard for a long time. Don't expect to be perfectly profitable in a few months, I've been trying this for a few years now and faced my own set of issues with being disciplined etc. 

Second, use whatever time you have everyday to learn for a week. After that, just start working asap. Look online, there will be atleast one online skill you can learn, eg thumbnail design, video editing. Focus on action. Trust me, action, even wrong ones is better than nothing. 

Don't be afraid of failure, be afraid of never trying.

Third, be willing to work for free. For additional guidance, look at people who are doing what you're doing at the level you'd want to be at. And their free content will be enough (atleast to get you started). 

Try to have some self reliance and be proactive about it. Your life is in your hands. The fact that you have an internet connection and you're young, says that you're already more privileged than a LOT of people in the world and this country. So use it wisely

They became quite viral for a while in mid 2010s. We invited them for a cleanup near our college where volunteers helped clear up a slum's entrance. Unfortunately it couldn't remain clean, it became full of garbage within a week. We were disappointed but this time we involved the community, we already operated a student run NGO there so we knew the kids. We went to their parents homes and tried to understand why they think the place got littered within days of us cleaning it giving it a makeover. They told us it's because what we did is not really any different from politicians giving lip service to the place. Bhaiya iska kya faayda? 

They told us there was no waste management to start with, the entrance was literally the only place they could dump their waste because it was next to a highway so ateast NHAI would sometimes clean it. What can the people do when local municipal governments don't operate? We have extremely weak municipal governments, see Indore, what they did was not only enable collective ownership but gave teeth to their municipal government to enforce cleanliness and introduce proper waste management systems. People give up when they grow up in an environment where no one cares and no one pays attention to them. Fortunately we were able to find a solution. 

We convinced our college dean to fund the garbage collection of this place, since it's a residential government college campus, we had garbage trucks come to collect waste everyday. There was also small waste management site on campus due to the large student population, probably 5000 or so faculty and students. This slum was just about 500 meters away from the college entrance and the folks coming to collect garbage and transport it to the dump site were from the same slum, as were many workers. This was a year long effort, but essentially it was only trivially more money to just collect the small slum's garbage and dispose it in our college. We held sessions with the people, especially kids, who helped in their keeping their parents accountable as well and it allowed us to keep the spot clean pretty much forever after. It also improved local cleaniless in general. 

No one likes to live in filth but people are forced to when they don't have a choice. No one actively takes a decision like that. Yes, there are entitled assholes but thinking they are rare but very loud. I hope there are more such grassroots actions people take. Identify what's causing the issue.",7,1743839644.0,False

unitedstatesofindia,1js61ze,"Weekly Random Discussion Thread - April 05, 2025 at 09:00PM",mll3llq,t3_1js61ze,flyingSavage2,"Okay, here's that analysis formatted for a Reddit post, using Markdown for better readability:


Digging into the Q1 User Stats - Some Interesting Insights!
Hey everyone, took a look at the Q1 activity table, and some fascinating patterns jumped out. Beyond just the raw comment counts, here's what caught my eye:



1. The Power Duo: jind_maahi_ & NOT_deadsix
 * These two absolutely dominate the top spots (#1 and #2 in comments).
 * But check this out: They are each other's number one ""Best Buddy"" by a huge margin (1616 & 1524 interactions listed). They're clearly interacting a lot.
 * Interestingly, while jind_maahi_ commented more, NOT_deadsix pulled in more total upvotes and has a higher average upvote (1.36) compared to jind_maahi_ (0.96). Quality over quantity, perhaps?




2. Volume Isn't Everything: Avg. Upvotes Tell a Story ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
 * High comment counts don't always equal the highest impact per comment.
 * The users with the highest Average Upvotes are way down the ranks by comment volume: pm_your_smiles_pls (#29) boasts a 2.15 average, and BrobdingnagianBudgie (#30) has 2.0! Seems their contributions, though fewer, really landed well.
 * On the flip side, some active users have lower average upvotes (like DesiAlexa at 0.24, Foodmaniack3 at 0.48, Zes4ty at 0.46).





3. Different Strokes: Breadth vs. Depth Commenters üó∫Ô∏è vs üéØ
 * We see different engagement styles:
   * flyingSavage2 (#3) is a great example of breadth. Fewer comments than the top two, but contributed to way more different posts (866). They seem to be active across many discussions.
   * jind_maahi_ (#1) exemplifies depth. Massive comment count (4519) but only across 90 posts. That's super focused commenting! gramer-jew (#24) also shows this (359 comments in 24 posts).





4. Who's Talking to Whom? Social Hubs ü§ù
 * Beyond the main jind_maahi_ / NOT_deadsix pair, other connections pop out:
   * souschef_6 & DecemberDiddy seem to interact a lot.
   * Foodmaniack3's top interactions are with flyingSavage2 & souschef_6.
   * souschef_4 & Foodmaniack2 have a link.
   * flyingSavage2 pops up often in others' ""Best Buddies,"" suggesting they're a key connector in the network.





5. The Enigma: PUNEET_WEAK_INDEX ü§î
 * Okay, what is this metric? The table doesn't say, but:
   * Chashnii (#11) has the highest value (7).
   * The top duo (jind_maahi_, NOT_deadsix) both score 6.
   * Loads of users, especially lower-ranked ones, have 0.
   * Doesn't seem directly tied to avg. upvotes or post breadth. Maybe it tracks a specific type of interaction or visibility? Pure speculation here!




Quick Data Note:



 * Looks like DesiAlexa (#16) is missing data for the CONTRIBUTION_TO_POSTS column.
Overall, it paints a cool picture of who's driving conversations, whose comments are hitting home, the different ways people participate, and the social links forming.

Even though he used his connections and other friends helped him out, that constable was pissed that he wrote it in English ( despite knowing Tamil) just to piss him off.

Language is the mode of communication and it all narrows down on whom you want to give the Burden of learning.... Obviously to those who had a hard time studying and reading, they won't be able to learn languages but highly educated and literate ones are able to do and they should learn at least some basics so that they can communicate easily (that was the only purpose of language).

These issues were always there...and will always be there and there is only one solution...mutual understanding....But the way hooliganism has started in recent times, it is not a natural course. This is a politically oriented, venomous act that started to create further division (caste politics didn't work so this one). And the scapegoats are obviously the common man while those holding threads are laughing in some AC rooms singing songs of the language of their choice.

(Scroll down for TLDR)

IMAO.. As it stands presently.. GLOBALLY Democracy is the biggest con now playing at a election near you.. 

This unfunny farce is starring, produced, scripted and directed by the ruling elite capitalist classes who have a captive audience namely, the compliant masses.. 

But on the other hand.. 

I dream of a future where democracy is rescued and resurrected by technology.. 

After all we should really be voting for and against POLICIES AND NOT POLITICIANS .. 

A new technology (just around the corner) can easily rid us of these useless middlemen ie. politicians who in theory have been democratically elected based on the policies that they have proposed for the betterment of the society.. But in reality are too busy pulling each other down while covering their own crimes.. 

Our current crop of power hungry politicians (and this is globally) operate just like the entitled tyrannical monarchs from history and rule over their fiefdoms (constituencies) like it is their own private backyard while regarding their subjects (the so called electorate) as nothing more than cannon fodder.. 

Where were stand today, globally, democracy is a cruel joke.. Because.. Democracy ceases to function efficiently when the disparities within a society get out of control.. When the differences between the haves and have-nots between the knowledgeable and the ignorant are too much then the very ground on which we place our so called democratic values is rather nonexistent and therefore a total lie.. A farce.. Add rampant capitalism to this scenerio and we have a global society where we literally worship money so then we might as well make the richest person in the land our supreme leader.. Why do all this farce of free and fair elections..ü§î

Ideally capitalist tendencies (the profit motive) should not be allowed to operate in atleast these 3 major ""industries"" namely 1. health care 2. education and 3. warfare.. But today in our rather twisted world we see the very same 3 sectors operating with the utmost greed, reaping ridiculous profits at the expense of perpetuating horrendous and inhumane social disparities.. All in the name of driving the so called ""economic growth"" of a so called ""nation"".. 

Yet there is hope and I am betting on a humane technology to come to our rescue.. Because history repeats itself.. Whenever humanity has faced any crises it has always been our innovations ie. technologies which have rescued us time and again.. These technologies can only be invented by a new generation who first question and then reject the old values because they see the world in a different way.. This new generation is already here.. The tools namely AI, AGI are also available.. Now only the will and the skill to make sincere creative efforts are needed.. I hope that this happens in my lifetime.. .. First imagine a world without any ""career politicians"" .. Then imagine a world where every citizen is in effect a politician because they have the power to not only directly vote on each and every policy that stands to affect them.. But also propose any policy that they wish to come into governance.. That would be so cool.. 

However for now until then.. What to do.. Well in my personal capacity, the above reasons stand for the fact that I have stopped voting.. Because I want to boycott not just our corrupt politicians but the insidious system itself.. I reject this false democracy and farce called elections..  ..Apparently there is the NOTA option.. But it a far fetched fantasy to hope that one day when people have got throughly fed up of the shenanigans of their political representatives the NOTA vote might actually emerge as the majority vote in the majority of constituencies polled! And it is naive to imagine that our power hungry politicians will ever let it come to that.. They would sooner declare Presidents rule or some sort of emergency rather than face the fact that they no longer have the public mandate.. Till then.. Live long and prosper.. 


TLDR.. Democracy breaks down when there is too much disparity in society because then this disparity is cunningly and cruelly leveraged by the corrupt politicians.. However with Technological advances there is hope that this system can be repaired.. After all we should BE VOTING FOR POLICIES AND NOT FOR POLITICIANS.. Technology can empower the electorate and finally make these middleman ie. politicians obsolete.. Computer ji pls help.. TILL THEN GATHER MOMENTUM TO BOYCOTT ELECTIONS",-9,1743859985.0,False

Yes they are, and Indian government is collaborating with Nvidia themselves to create a chip of our own, it would most likely be a under-powered GPU on an architecture Nvidia already created.

1. **Claim**: Union Minister Kiren Rijiju stated that the Waqf Board illegally claimed a temple in Tiruchendurai, Tamil Nadu.
   - **Fact**: The Tamil Nadu Waqf Board head refuted this claim, stating that only some portions of the village were involved, not the entire village, and the temple remains unaffected[3]. Historical records show Queen Rani Mangammal donated land to Waqf in the 18th century[3].

2. **Claim**: DMK leader A Raja called Rijiju‚Äôs claim a ‚Äúcock-and-bull story.‚Äù
   - **Fact**: A Raja did challenge Rijiju‚Äôs claims, suggesting they were misleading and inconsistent with judicial findings.

3. **Claim**: The Waqf Board can claim any property as its own.
   - **Fact**: This is false. The Waqf Board can only manage properties legally dedicated to it under Muslim law[2][7].

4. **Claim**: The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is based on a conspiracy theory of ‚Äúland jihad.‚Äù
   - **Fact**: The narrative of ‚Äúland jihad‚Äù is a political narrative used to portray Waqf boards as land encroachers, which is not supported by evidence[5]. The bill aims to reform Waqf board powers and property management[6].

Firstly and lastly they get islamic nation because they ask for it and second the communalism never grew to that size on the india side it existed but didn't grew to that side infact hindu mahasabha was once an allie of Muslim league against congress so yeah that's the irony of time 

Waqf can't claim any property without strong evidence the part which bjp is talking about right now is that they'll make it transparent

 the reason they won't be trusted because when their own people were against it and couldn't put together a detailed report about it clearly and uses misinformation and justification in the house who'll feel good at letting them handle things

The fact that waqf land is also encroached by a lot of people by the government data and it will literally get control of government then they'll be able to decide what land is supposed to stay and what not bjp himself make itself look bad and now they can do politics regarding this
Despite that 40000 litigation case is going on if bjp could've broadened the horizon for fast hearing of this case that could be beneficial but instead bjp taking away the rights by which waqf can claim lands which was also linked to the encroached property of waqf 

This confusion is perfectly shown by the right leaning media where they're waqf board holding more land in hindu majority village including temples which is a clickbait tbh 

In reality the temple was never of the waqf but some acres of land near the village is in fact is waqf land situation like this where waqf board have evidence of queen donating lands to them and the voter based of bjp exists , who tf bjp will choose if suppose a hindu encroaching on waqf land is found,  is the waqf will be compensated in behalf of the hindu or waqf won't get the permission to claim his lands this can easily created the communal prblm which is the goldmines bjp is seeking.


Let's look at the kerala incident where lots of majority Christian and hindus lives at that place I think munamban or something like that place was found out to be a land donated to waqf later encroachment happened by the local population it was forgotten for the long time when it was registered as waqf land this create some tax prblm and this was also highlighted by the right wing and many people but they put down waqf interest here choose the present population over it now case is going on and govt assured nothing will happen to locals since case is pending but someone needs to step up at one point bjp is not stepping up for that. 

This type incident is the reason why the otherside might not support BJP amendment but bjp gonna make it problematic for all 

I believe if bjp can handle the litigation case first that could really benefit a lot of people including 9492 cases of Muslim issued cases first and then the inside cases of waqf.

It‚Äôs a mirror that doesn‚Äôt lie. If the Manmohan Singh government is known for its progressive legislations like rural job guarantee scheme Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), Right to Information (RTI) and Food Security Act (FSA), the Narendra Modi regime generated maximum noise through measures like Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), abolition of Article 370, farm laws and the Waqf Amendment Bill.¬†

Amidst the myriad battlefields that our politics has created, people‚Äôs rights are probably the most critical conflict crying for the nation‚Äôs attention. The buzzword during Manmohan‚Äôs tenure between 2004 and 2014 was ‚Äúrights-based‚Äù legislations. It was a unique concept that envisioned people‚Äôs empowerment through legal guarantees. Political imagination appears to have undergone a sea change under Modi after 2014, manifested vividly through legislations, administrative outlook and narratives. Now the first suspicion of political opponents and intelligentsia invariably is ‚Äì somebody‚Äôs rights are going to be curtailed. More than the legislative merits of the draft, the intent of the government comes under question.¬†

The first dramatic shift came in the form of an ordinance at the very outset of Modi‚Äôs first term when the historic Land Acquisition Act was sought to be diluted. The Congress and the farmers said Modi wanted to favour the industries at the cost of the poor people. That triggered a massive political storm, forcing the government to step back. This, along with reckless decisions like changing the rules to allot more than one airport to a private party, unambiguously demonstrated Modi‚Äôs inclination towards a pro-corporate policy. As more layers of decision-making got unwrapped, the opposition parties alleged that the pro-corporate tilt was turning into full-fledged crony capitalism.¬†",4,1743838002.0,True
unitedstatesofindia,1jry0c1,"MGNREGA, RTI, Food Security Versus CAA, Wakf, 370: A Comparison of Manmohan and Modi's Lawmaking",mliapxp,t1_mliabh7,frizene26,"What, however, dominated the political discourse was the emerging trajectory showing a clear intent to enforce the ideological agenda. Different sections of society ‚Äì students, farmers, workers and Muslims ‚Äì felt their rights were being trampled by a political design. If the unrest in JNU and other institutions signaled an attempt to manipulate the academic culture, CAA triggered widespread fears among Muslims and secular citizens who sustained for months unprecedented agitations across the country. This was followed by the historic farmers‚Äô movement for around a year in which lakhs of people sat in protest on roads outside the nation‚Äôs capital in extreme heat and tormenting rains.¬†Over 700 farmers¬†died¬†as ministers and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders kept hailing the three laws that generated apprehensions of a sinister design to facilitate corporate 
takeover of agriculture trade. Though the prime minister finally relented after 12 months to withdraw the laws, India discovered to her horror that laws can create ripples of joy as well as trail of destruction.

Manmohan had shown how MGNREGA spurred economic activities across rural India and Modi had demonstrated how CAA and farm laws could incite a social turmoil. Modi‚Äôs most ambitious initiative ‚Äì demonetisation ‚Äì had achieved far worse. It caused a socio-economic upheaval of unparalleled magnitude, resulting in catastrophic fallouts like massive job losses, closure of thriving industries, economic slowdown and disturbing humanitarian miseries.¬†No other policy in the history of independent India inflicted such wounds on the people and the economy. Then came the Covid pandemic and the thoughtless lockdowns, triggering another wave of unprecedented miseries, deaths and destruction. The Manmohan government had also faced the 2008 global financial crisis but the masses were largely kept insulated from the shocks. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government persisted with its pro-people agenda, pushing ahead with legislations like Aadhar, Right to Education (RTE), Street Vendors Act and FSA. It showed democratic responsiveness by meaningfully engaging with protesters to enact legislations for Lokayukta and safety of women.¬†

Previous governments since Independence had navigated difficult legislations and revolutionary decisions without much social turmoil during India‚Äôs formative years when wretched poverty created easy conditions for conflicts and crisis. Apart from creating an industrial base and institutions of eternal importance, critical laws like anti-Dowry Act, Representation of People‚Äôs Act, Prevention of Corruption Act, Essential Commodities Act, Anti-Defection Act, Child Labour Act, Prevention of Atrocities on SC-ST Act, Panchayati Raj, MPLADS, Abolition of Privy Purses, nationalisation of banks, mid-day meal scheme, etc. Governments achieved states reorganisation, green revolution, white revolution, telecom revolution, information technology, Mandal Commission and many other legislations with far reaching consequences without much upheaval

Modi, who proudly flaunts that his risk-taking capacity has not been fully utilised, has valid reasons to introspect why so many of his decisions evoked widespread protests and created social turmoil. Peaceful protests were crushed using police force at several places during the anti-CAA agitation. Students were assaulted inside universities, members of civil society were defamed and arrested merely for raising their voices against a government decision. After removal of Article 370, Kashmir was contained by brute force; while thousands of politicians and people were put under arrest, there was a curfew-like situation ‚Äì with even internet shut ‚Äì for months. It is not healthy in a democracy that the intent and purpose of the government in bringing legislations comes under suspicion.¬†An amendment to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was seen by the entire opposition as a ploy to crush dissent",2,1743838252.0,True

Whether it is the reckless use of bulldozers or the toxic communal narrative, digging up newer temple-mosque disputes or the deathless whisper campaign against their cultural ethos and food habits, an atmosphere of bias and discrimination has been created over the decade. The passage of the Waqf Bill despite fierce opposition from the Muslim community and a large number of political parties has reignited these fears. What if another anti-CAA like movement starts in the country? Is it desirable to have social turmoil at a time when the world is grappling with tariff wars and economic uncertainties? Has the Modi government learnt any lessons from the bitter experiences of CAA and farm laws? Or is it a deliberate ploy to divert attention from the menacing unemployment and lurking financial troubles?

There was no point in pushing the farm laws without taking the farmers in confidence. There is no need to bulldoze the Waqf Bill against an emotional resistance by the Muslim community. Modi needs to recognise the virtue of consultation in democracy. If he doesn‚Äôt, his risk-taking capacity can drive him to another note-bandi like madness. He needs to look within and learn. He supported the demand for MSP (minimum support price) for farmers when he was the chief minister. He ate his words after he became the prime minister.

He created such a ruckus on Manmohan‚Äôs policy of allocation of 2G spectrum and coal blocks on first-come-first-serve basis and then went to the Supreme Court seeking change in its 2012 judgment to allow allocation of spectrum without auction.

indianews,1jsowrs,‚ÄúBillionaire Kids Are Hijacking Startups?‚Äù Piyush Goyal Drops a Bombshell!,mlo2an0,t3_1jsowrs,Historical-Yard4623,"Union Minister Piyush Goyal recently made some strong comments about the direction of India‚Äôs startup culture. Speaking at Startup Mahakumbh 2025 in New Delhi, he said that luxury brands started by billionaire children should not be seen as real startups.

He said that real innovation should solve big, important problems‚Äînot just make expensive cookies or ice cream. He shared how, wherever he goes, he hears about at least three or four children of billionaires starting fancy brands. While he has no issue with that, he asked if that‚Äôs all India is aiming for.

He pointed out that many of these so-called startups just take regular products, make the packaging look nice, use terms like ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù ‚Äúvegan,‚Äù or ‚Äúgluten-free,‚Äù and then market them as startups. According to him, these are just regular businesses, not real innovation.

Goyal emphasized that India, even though it has the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, needs to focus more on deep-tech, manufacturing, and solving large-scale problems. He said that just creating luxury brands doesn't help India become a tech leader globally.

He also questioned whether India is happy doing small delivery and gig work while other countries like China are making big moves in technology, electric vehicles, and battery systems. He urged young entrepreneurs to aim higher and build businesses that truly make a difference, not just ones that make quick money.

The difference back then was the hate/racism was directed towards women, Jews, LGBTQ, black/chinese people, people with disabilities, and then based on politics. After 9/11 the hate expanded to include Arabs and Muslims. Indians are just a new addition to this very long and growing list of targets to hate. Broadband, fiber internet, cheap mobile data just increased the speed at which hate speech spread, the content evolved from largely text/audio to videos and reels and AI videos now.

Indians weren't vocal or visible enough for the internet to take notice before cheap internet and mobile data brought an explosion of content from India towards western eyes. You have to understand that most of them don't have any idea about where India is, or what our culture is. The first things they see about India are cringe instagram reels and the worst aspects of India, thanks to these algorithms that push the most controversial content for maximum revenue. This is where we have to accept blame because it's our massive userbase that pushes this content to the top of popular feeds. They don't actively go searching for Indian content to hate on.

Facebook, whatsapp and instagram are the worst offenders when it comes to promoting hate all over the world. Twitter/X joined the hate bandwagon and became a great additional tool to target individuals and organisations. Reddit used to be somewhat neutral/left leaning, that embraced diversity, but we have maybe a year left before this place gets overwhelmed by the constant barrage of hate.

The questions you have asked are not new, you can replace Indian with any one of the groups that have been facing targeted hate for far longer, and the eventual answer is going to be the same - 

1. Internet battles are pointless. There's always going to be idiots who spew uneducated shit as long as they have a platform. You are wasting your time if you engage with them. They have nothing better to do with their time, and exist solely to get the reaction they want from you and then they move on to their next victim. Earlier, these idiots were limited by their poor grammar, spelling and vocabulary, but AI has bridged that gap splendidly, so now you get to see the worst use cases of technology. The content they produce is still dumb, but spectacularly dumb thanks to the visual elements.

2. There was nobody to guide my generation on internet content. It was the wild west then, still is, for the most part, just that the popular public part of it has been toned down. While the easy answer is government censorship of such content, and control of the internet, like China, the practical answer is to laugh it off. Treat it like some terrible standup comedy and make it even more absurd. Instead of anger and hate towards racists, respond with laughter and ridicule.

We have forced our way onto the main stage, through the power of Jio, and when you're on that stage, you get a lot of attention. What we do with that kind of attention is now up to the younger generation. The internet, and largely social media, these days, should be treated as a gigantic amplifier. If you are creating content, or contributing to it, you control the narrative. If you are resharing content, you control the reach/audience. If you are just reacting to it, you are the audience. 

Consider all of this racist content you are being exposed to as an evolutionary mechanism. You have to be better than the morons propagating it. If your friends are reacting negatively to it, take some initiative and reassure them, not everyone has thick skin to face bullying/racism head on and confront it. 

Do not engage with that crap content, only report/hide. The algorithms will eventually figure it out. If you engage with it, you will only get more of the same shit. It's the same thing as boycotting a product/company. You have to take control of your own life and choices on how you spend your time and money. If you want to fight online battles against racist trolls, go ahead, most people will applaud you for it, but it shouldn't be your primary activity. Everyone loses, in the end.

indianews,1jsqm9d,Andhra Pradesh Is Sitting on an Insane Uranium Jackpot,mlodtzk,t3_1jsqm9d,Historical-Yard4623,"Over the past five years, India has discovered more than 93,000 tonnes of uranium resources within the country, mainly in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, the government recently informed the Parliament.

In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Union Minister of State for Atomic Energy Jitendra Singh said that between 2020 and December 2024, the Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD) found a total of 93,700 tonnes of in-situ uranium oxide resources across four states.

Andhra Pradesh accounted for the highest amount with 60,659 tonnes, followed by Jharkhand with 27,156 tonnes. Smaller reserves were also discovered in Rajasthan and Karnataka.

The minister said that preliminary approval has been given for starting 13 uranium-related projects. These include expanding existing facilities and setting up new mines and processing plants.

Preparatory work has begun to get the necessary clearances from central and state authorities.

Once these projects become fully operational, they are expected to produce about 11.5 million tonnes of uranium ore per year and yield around 1,095 tonnes of U3O8 (triuranium octoxide), which is used in nuclear fuel.

However, these projects are still in the early stages. The government is currently working on getting the required statutory approvals. Funding will be decided once the detailed project reports are finalised and the necessary administrative and financial approvals are in place.

The minister also said that new uranium deposits have been identified in the Jaduguda North - Baglasai - Mechua area in East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand. This site is an extension of the existing Jaduguda uranium deposit and is expected to significantly boost India's long-term nuclear fuel supply.

They're responsible for the rise of BJP in Uttar Pradesh. In the 2000s and in the early 2010s, BJP was virtually rendered extinct in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, but due to Samajwadi Party's excessive pandering to religious extremism and BSP's financial corruption, BJP made a massive comeback in rural areas. During SP and BSP, money was only allocated to cities like Lucknow, Ghaziabad and Noida while rural areas suffocated in poverty. The same is happening in BJP's tenure. The CPI(M) should capitalise on this and make inroads in impoverished rural areas. Samajwadi Party is inherently a misogynistic and casteist party just like the BJP, the only difference is that Samajwadi Party panders to Islamic extremists while BJP is literally an entity of Hindu extremists.¬†",3,1743834196.0,False

The upper caste voters are firmly in BJP's column now, except some rural and older voters who vote for Congress purely out of nostalgia. BJP was not able to mobilise its upper caste support on this level even during the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, it's pretty intriguing how Modi has brought literally all upper caste voters of all socioeconomic stripes into his fold.

To think that Chile was envisioning the history of ""Big Data"" with rudimentary computers even by the standard of their time is just bonkers. And the fact that we lost it all is a harrowing thought and one of the core reasons why I am so miserable always. 

The most amazing thing about Project Cybersyn was that it helped navigate the trucks during the CIA funded protests without lifting a single police baton. 

A really fun fact about Project Cybersyn is that Stafford Beer and Friedrich Hayek knew each other and used to be on talking terms. Hayek would tell him on multiple occasions that such a detailed centralized system would be impossible to make much less to make it work efficiently. Beer would always counter him that he can given that he was a tech guy after all. In the end Beer won the battle. Today that type of technology is used everywhere from inventory to workforce management.

Me and the homies sharing mammoth meat, no private property, no gyatt rizz, just vibes. Skibidi toilet? More like skibidi communal latrine. Livvy Dunne? Never heard of her. Baby Gronk? Just a baby. Fanum tax? More like Fanum share.



Feudalism:

Oh no, the king rolled up in his Mahindra Thar and said, ""Whatdadogdoin?"" Now we‚Äôre serfs, farming G-Fuel for the lords of Muscle Engineers. Skibidi toilets are now a luxury item. Livvy Dunne is the queen, and Baby Gronk is her jester. Fanum taxes us 36 backshots a day. Dark times.



Capitalism:

Skibidi toilets are now a commodity. Livvy Dunne is an influencer selling gyatt rizz courses. Baby Gronk signed a sponsorship deal with G-Fuel. Fanum opened a tax consultancy firm. The Mahindra Thar is now a status symbol. Ohio is the global economic hub.



Socialism:

The workers seize the means of Skibidi toilet production. Livvy Dunne‚Äôs gyatt rizz is collectivized. Baby Gronk distributes G-Fuel to the masses. Fanum‚Äôs taxes are redistributed. The Mahindra Thar is now public transportation. Ohio is a utopia.



Scientific Communism:

Skibidi toilets are fully automated. Livvy Dunne‚Äôs gyatt rizz is optimized by AI. Baby Gronk achieves post-scarcity G-Fuel distribution. Fanum‚Äôs taxes are abolished. The Mahindra Thar is a relic in the Museum of Late-Stage Capitalism. Ohio transcends space and time.

Ensuring female presence is also good.   

Like, recently read news about Muslim couples in Kerala remarrying under the Special Marriage Act, because under the current Indian Islamic religious law, female children would only get half of what a male child gets. Such stuff is bad and thus moves to bring about changes is good.

People along with Thanos assumed that halving the people will cause people to have more resources (products), but that isn't true.

Resources don't have their own value, even gold doesn't, it's the labour of extracting that gold, melting it, recasting it, transporting it, testing quality, storing it.

And funny enough they hate and sht on police 

But on the other hand they'll support the army and soldiers in any case showing them as some saint who can't do wrong if anybody is caught doing things abuse will be given to individuals not to the sectors

This shows itself how responsibility and biasedness is supported by people and POLITICIAN due to which military and police can be wrong and oppressive when it's the opposite person ruling and 

it can't be oppressive or can't cause any failure when they themselves rule it 

Which resulted in mass graves, mass rapes and brainwashing of youth in particular isolated places like kashmir and maoist prone area where a chain reaction of youth start hating the army for it's mistake and blunder 

Funny enough it won't get much highlight or neither the criticism due to which people will only listen to the one side and not the full side today's youth dedication towards the blind nationalism disregard for future prblm they're causing right now is evident that why army getting criticised is a taboo meanwhile recently rajnath singh along with army apologised to the victim who dies in Crossfire but when state is malign and every thing is done who'll feel bad for others they'll infact say army all the time right and anybody criticising it is wrong.",2,1743614728.0,False

**1. The Employee (the one walking like a dog):**

* His self-worth is **either very low** or has been **completely suppressed**.
* He may have **sacrificed his dignity** for approval, money, job security, or out of fear.
* If it was consensual (as part of a fetish or kink), it still shows he‚Äôs **comfortable surrendering his autonomy**, which could stem from escapism, trauma, or a deep need to submit.

**2. The Boss (the one holding the leash):**

* Most likely **power-hungry**, **ego-driven**, or deeply **insecure**.
* He feels superior by degrading others, which often hides an **inner emptiness** or **childhood trauma**.
* Anyone who *needs* to dominate to feel powerful is usually afraid of vulnerability and lacks real confidence.

# üõ†Ô∏è How can they fix themselves?

# üß† Step 1: Self-awareness

* Understand the **real psychological reasons** behind their actions.
* Journaling, deep introspection, or talking to a therapist can help uncover hidden patterns.

# üßπ Step 2: Clean the shame

* People who allow themselves to be degraded often carry deep **shame**.
* That shame says: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not worthy.‚Äù
* The fix: **Radical self-acceptance** and learning to build **boundaries**.

# üîÑ Step 3: Redefine power

* The boss needs to learn that real power comes from **respect, not humiliation**.
* The employee needs to realize that **true strength** is standing tall, not crawling on the ground.

# üí¨ Step 4: Therapy or Conscious Mentorship

* Both of them likely need **trauma-informed therapy**.
* Many of these behaviors are **repeated patterns from childhood** that are just showing up in adulthood in extreme ways.

# üîì In Short:

* This is a **toxic psychological loop** of power imbalance.
* One seeks control, the other seeks validation.
* Healing begins when they both understand their **core emotional wounds** and commit to **inner growth**.",1,1743928095.0,False

And also that you respect every single language without saying that one is better than the other. I speak pretty good Hindi, excellent English (not to toot my own horn but my English is pretty good), and Telugu happens to be my native language. That‚Äôs 3 right there. I have no problem learning other languages either, whether it be Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, Odia, Bengali, Marathi, Gujrati, Punjabi, Marwari. Just to name a few.

Now, my stance on languages can be boiled down to this. You don‚Äôt have to become perfect at the local language of wherever you live. You can communicate in English or whatever your language is, provided that the other person understands it. But do not impose a language on people just because you think it‚Äôs more mainstream. Like, if you observe cities in South India, like Hyderabad,  and Bangalore in particular are very accommodating to Hindi speaking people. There aren‚Äôt any cities in UP, MP, Maharashtra or Delhi that offer the same sort of flexibility as far as South Indian languages are concerned. Yet, people from South India are expected to learn Hindi and kind of made fun of and shamed if they don‚Äôt. Yet, people from up north, if they come to live in South India, don‚Äôt try to learn the local language and expect others around them to accommodate Hindi. Again, I have nothing against any language.

By using the knowledge of caveman and by using the best methods available at that time water can be known to be important for living and poisonous plants are harmful, etc. By the things we know today and our advanced methods for identifying which are good and bad we can still show water is good, we can also identify if there are beneficial things in what are thought to be harmful and harmful things which are thought to be beneficial by conducting more robust studies which were not available to caveman.
That was the whole point of evolving our scientific method, to better understand which is good and bad. If you want to keep using old methods which are shown to fail in identifying sometimes is just irrational.
To give an analogy. In olden days it was completely acceptable to think Sun goes around the earth because that's based on the evidence available at that time. If someone says no earth goes around the sun without showing why he's saying that or with evidence that's known to be false, then even if it is true that person will be called a liar because he's knowingly spreading misinformation (even if later it turned out to be true).

Cultural Revolution (1966-1976): 
Under Mao Zedong, CCP initially sought to dismantle traditional ZhongGuo culture, targeting the ‚ÄúFour Olds‚Äù (old customs, old culture, old habits, old ideas). 

This period saw the widespread destruction of cultural heritage, including religious & historical sites, as communism sought to reshape society.

Post-Mao Era & Cultural Revival: 
After Mao‚Äôs death, especially under Deng Xiaoping & subsequent leaders, ZhongGuo has re-embraced certain cultural aspects. 

The government promotes a balance between modernization & cultural heritage. 

ZhongGuo communism, today under the leadership of CCP, glorifies elements of traditional Han culture, such as Confucianism, historical pride, & national symbols. 

This is often intertwined with nationalism, emphasizing a sense of ZhongGuo identity that blends communist ideology with cultural pride.

You can still find thousand-year-old temples in China's major cities, in the mountains, and elsewhere. Daoism, which even predates Buddhism, is still practiced in China. Turns out, you can't break people's belief systems with force. Also, learn why ordinary Chinese people supported the Communist forces instead of the Nationalists during the civil war.

And Confucianism isn‚Äôt some religion‚Äîit‚Äôs a philosophy that shaped Chinese society. The whole concept of ‚ÄúSocialism with Chinese characteristics‚Äù is essentially a market economy model combined with a top-down, centralized system. Confucianism, too, emphasizes a top-down, centralized order and prioritizes collectivism, giving importance to the state and society over individuals. It has historically shaped China. Confucianism is more of a political philosophy than a spiritual one, unlike Daoism & Buddhism.


Mao was an asshole, but imagine thinking that ten years of the Cultural Revolution could destroy thousands of years of culture‚Äîlol. China faced the Mongols and The Genghis Khan himself, yet its culture survived. After the Mongols, the Manchus ruled China, but Chinese culture still endured.

You're worshipping Japan, but read about the persecution of Buddhists during the Meiji Restoration, when Japan wanted to modernize rapidly to protect itself from Western colonialism. And Buddhism was seen as Backward. That was the origin of State Shintoism. Anyway, Buddhists are a small minority even in India‚Äîlol.

Go to the Indian History sub or Ask Historians sub. The Chinese still have so many historical records & pamphlets from thousands of years ago that archaeologists often get confused about what's actually important and which writings are just recording trivial stuff.

National Identity: 
In ZhongGuo, CCP has worked to forge a strong monolithic national identity that includes a significant Han cultural revival, while in India, communists have generally focused on class struggle, economic reforms, & secularism, sometimes at odds with the traditional social fabric.

Cultural Tradition vs. Progressivism: 
Indian communists have historically focused on promoting secularism, rationalism, & social justice, often advocating for the dismantling of caste-based hierarchies & challenging deeply entrenched traditional practices. 

They see traditional religious practices & superstitions as obstacles to the progress of society, which is why they sometimes appear antagonistic to cultural conservatism.

Secular Socialism: 
Indian communists are often secular & see traditional cultural values as being intertwined with religious & caste systems that they oppose.

 The emphasis in India has been on class struggle & the liberation of the working class, often overshadowing the preservation of cultural traditions. 

The goal of social equality & economic justice has often led to criticism of traditional hierarchies, such as those based on caste / religion, which have been deeply embedded in Indian culture.

Communism‚Äôs Limited Success in India: 
Indian communism, especially in its early years, was influenced by Marxist ideologies which often viewed the cultural & religious traditions as impediments to economic development and social equality. 

The communist parties have found it difficult to integrate themselves fully into the fabric of Indian society, where religion & traditional values are deeply ingrained.",11,1743840562.0,False

India had rulers like Aurangzeb. Genghis Khan killed 40 million people across China and Iran, and the Mongols burned several libraries. If cultures can survive such catastrophic periods and still evolve, then Mao Zedong‚Äôs era was only a minor phase. It did not lead to the complete destruction of Chinese culture as often portrayed by Western media.

Mao‚Äôs famines undoubtedly changed people‚Äôs diets‚Äîeating anything that moved became a survival tactic‚Äîbut it‚Äôs not like the Chinese forgot their ancient cuisines & ancient food culture, like Peking Duck, lamian (which Japan marketed to the world as ramen), Sichuan dishes, etc. Events like the Cultural Revolution transformed Chinese culture, but didn‚Äôt destroy it. People adapted. That‚Äôs how cultures have survived for thousands of years, despite invasions, epidemics, and famines.

I‚Äôm simply pointing out that there was a dedicated U.S.-backed propaganda effort to paint USSR as  godless, cultureless, evil communist atheists‚Äîwhile portraying the USA as a religious, God-loving nation with superior morals (essentially, white Christian nationalism). But that portrayal was far from the truth. Russian culture, the Russian Orthodox Church, Russian Christianity, its Mongol-era architecture, and its philosophical and literary heritage‚Äîincluding authors like Dostoevsky‚Äî, Russian Muslim population, all survived Stalin‚Äôs era ( Russia is probably more diverse than any western European country )

The same U.S. propaganda narrative has been used with China. If you didn‚Äôt know, the U.S. government officially spends $1.5 billion annually to spread anti-China propaganda across the world, through media & international programs like USAID (which, fortunately, Trump shut down‚ÄîUSAID also meddles in other countries' domestic politics). Cutting USAID was ironically an own goal, as China has always despised it. 

( U.S. has the most sophisticated and powerful instruments that shape the global narrative & people's opinions on things. This is backed by the dominance of English as the international language, which serves as a window for people from other countries to observe, connect, and communicate with the rest of the world. That's how American cultural trends‚Äîlike Hollywood, LGBTQ+ movements, or more recent toxic phenomena like white supremacist Andrew Tate-style content and GamerGate‚Äîspread globally.)",3,1743921994.0,False

I discovered this song back in COVID lockdown. This same song can take me to places normally I can't even fathom. Same song can make me feel happy and hopeful for better future. And sometimes when I'm low and listen to this song so that I can feel better this same song can give me extremely painful existential crisis (though it might be because of some other underline issues with me). 

Music have different effect on everyone. And with age too music just starts to feel different. Like I still have my father's old cassettes with songs from 50s, 60s, 70s etc. I couldn't understand the appeal of those songs and why my father used to love them. And now when I'm of the age when he first became father, I can understand little bit about why he still keeps those cassettes and listens to those songs.",1,1743931344.0,False

You‚Äôll find loads of articles from the 90‚Äôs and 2000‚Äôs. We were constantly barraged with articles about how the air in China/Korea/Japan is unbreathable and everyone has to wear a mask. For the longest time I honestly thought the air in those countries was black smoke. It wasn‚Äôt until later I realized that it was exaggerated. Having said that, for someone with so much influence and fame to do this racist karma farming garbage in the current racist climate  is an asshole move. He‚Äôs a narcissistic asshole. 

What I‚Äôm about to say doesn‚Äôt mean India doesn‚Äôt have problems to fix when it comes to its air quality and other things but there is a propaganda push against Indians to hurt both the country and the NRI‚Äôs. Recognizing that there is a forced anti-indian propaganda  doesn‚Äôt negate the issues to fix. It‚Äôs not mutually exclusive. There‚Äôs both. The fact that there has been anti-indian propaganda is not untrue. In 2022 there was that California bill that psychotic lefties tried to pass. It came out of nowhere and it made no sense but the women behind that is a proven paid plant meant to hurt the NRI diaspora especially in Cali. 

What‚Äôs amazing to me is how abysmal the indian government is at even countering the anti-indian hate. They‚Äôve done nothing. How do you sit there with blinders on when your people abroad and here are actively targeted, harassed and preyed on. They could follow the money of some of the earliest anti-indian online influencers when it all started. I read an article a little while ago about how a bunch of African influencers were paid to push anti-indian hate and propaganda. I‚Äôve visited a couple of African countries. They were honestly worse in every way. But somebody paid them to. India has an intelligence agency, get to the root and have the journalists do their thing. Stop watching the videos of these influencers and commenting on it and giving them views. Comment and push the videos of the influencers who aren‚Äôt like this. 

The government has been a disappointment at the end of the day. Much of what Indians had every right to expect, the government didn‚Äôt deliver. The politicians from the boomer generation and the generation before were terrible at tackling sociocultural, judicial or infrastructure reforms. They never messaged aggressively against sexual assaults, never tried to modernize away from so many toxic sociocultural issues, never took consistent action to change these problems. It‚Äôs as if they were single track minded about growing the economy, while ignoring the vast majority of other issues. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt grasp PR.

Made $800 million.
Now spends his life eating veggies, swallowing 50+ pills a day, and tracking how long his erections last.
All to not die.
(And yes, he sells a vitamin plan too. Let‚Äôs talk.)

2---
He says he‚Äôs not doing it for money.
Because billionaires never lie, right?
Meanwhile, he‚Äôs selling a multivitamin called ‚ÄúBlueprint‚Äù based on his own lifestyle‚Äîzero clinical backing, all Silicon Valley swag.

3--
This man micro-manages every calorie, measures over 100+ biomarkers daily, and once injected his son‚Äôs blood plasma into himself.
Just father-son things.
Totally not weird or desperate.

4---
He took rapamycin, a serious immunosuppressant, because some mice lived longer on it.
He stopped when it gave him infections and possibly sped up his aging.
Oops.
#Science?

5---
He claims to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, and the brain of an 18-year-old.
But somehow still talks like a walking TED Talk in a midlife crisis.

6---
People say, ‚ÄúHe already made his money, why would he fake it?‚Äù
Easy.
Because selling hope is the most profitable business model ever invented.
Especially when you slap ‚Äúbiohacking‚Äù and ‚Äúlongevity‚Äù on the label.

7---
This isn‚Äôt medicine. It‚Äôs a tech-bro religion.
A multivitamin messiah with a messiah complex.
He‚Äôs not reversing age‚Äîhe‚Äôs just monetizing insecurity, one pill at a time.

8---
Bryan Johnson isn‚Äôt a doctor.
He‚Äôs not your savior.
He‚Äôs Goop for guys who own crypto and wear Oura rings to bed.

9---
If you want to live longer:

Sleep well

Eat real food

Exercise

Don‚Äôt fall for rich dudes selling anti-death snake oil

I cannot believe the garbage I have just read. How can someone even type what you have typed? Did you put your mind to rest when you were typing it? The absurdity of your comments really annoy me. I hope you are not simply copy-pasting from online Islamic blogs and Dawah Sites because they are just garbage articles written by Muslim propagandists in a self-attested way without any counter questioning. They get paid money by countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc to write that bullshit and they always get exposed later and then they run.

Dr. Keith Moore was slammed by his own colleagues like PZ Myers for his ridiculous claims when he took money from Saudi Arabia to lie about Embryo formation in Quran. He was slammed by the University of California for lying. 

As, I have mentioned in my previous comments there are ZERO indications of anything scientific or even anything logical in Quran whether related to the Universe or whether Embryos.

As, a matter of fact Quran mentions everything OPPOSITE and CONTRARY to science. 

Here is how:

**1. Embryo formation:**

**‚ÄúWe created man from a drop of sperm, then We made him a clinging clot (*****alaqah*****), then We made the clot into a lump (*****mudghah*****), then We made the lump bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh...‚Äù**  
‚Äî *Surah Al-Mu‚Äôminun (23:13-14)*

This is bullshit. It claims opposite of what actually happens.

The Sequence is Biologically Incorrect

The verse says:

Clot ‚Üí Lump ‚Üí Bones ‚Üí Flesh

**But in reality:**

Flesh and bones develop simultaneously.

Muscle and cartilage tissues develop in parallel, not one after the other.

The muscle tissue doesn‚Äôt ""cover"" bare bones as described in the verse.

**Scientific problem:** This is not how embryonic development works at all

Fertilization doesn‚Äôt happen from a ""drop of sperm"" alone ‚Äî it‚Äôs a single sperm fertilizing a female egg (ovum).

Quran never mentions the ovum or female contribution, which is scientifically essential.

**Scientific problem: The Quran describes reproduction as male-centric, which reflects ancient Greek or pre-modern embryology, not modern science.**

Missing from the Quran:

Ovum / egg

Uterus / womb wall implantation details

Cell division, blastocyst, zygote

Germ layers, neural tube, organ development

Any precise timelines or stages (which modern embryology is based on)

**Scientific problem:** The Quran‚Äôs description is vague, metaphorical, and lacks anatomical accuracy.

  
2. **Universe**:

I'm laughing while I even type this. Hahahahahahahahaha. 

The Quran never states the age of the Earth or universe

It never gives a number of years for anything. No mention of 13.8 billion or 4.54 billion or even ""billions."" There‚Äôs no claim in the Quran that these ‚Äúdays‚Äù are proportionally tied to modern time. It ignores billions of years of detail, including the formation of stars, galaxies, solar systems, etc. Any random ratio (1/2, 1/4, 2/5) can be retrofitted to some scientific number. The Quranic language is metaphorical, theological, not quantitative science. So any claim of a match is always post hoc reinterpretation.



You can make up these stories for HARRY POTTER books as well and say that Harry Potter contains scientific knowledge and Harry Potter is your prophet.

This was known knowledge. Earliest text wad by hippocrtes at 370 BC. And later by Aristotle. Also check Galen, Sushrut or even egyptian works. Nothing new at that time.

Start learning other books predating quran. Most of the so called scientific facts are just fudged from previous books. Nothing new.

>This aligns with modern cosmological discoveries about the universe‚Äôs continuous expansion.

What kind of reply have you given? Is there any sense in it?
You have copy pasted these things from some Islamic blog you found online.

The Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, long after the Big Bang (13.8 billion years ago), and it took millions of years to cool, form continents, oceans, and become habitable. There is absolutely nothing in the Quran related to that. Instead it claims the vague 2 day and 6 day nonsense. 

Moreover, it talks about the creation of ""heavens"". There are no ""heavens"" in the Big Bang. Heaven is an unverified and non-existent entity (lol)


In the 1980s, Keith Moore was approached by Islamic scholars and the Embryology Committee of Saudi Arabia, particularly associated with Zakir Naik's circle and King Abdulaziz University. He was paid for consulting on Islamic projects and giving talks in Saudi Arabia. 

Keith Moore was PAID money to lie about Quran. He got exposed later. 

This is the nonsense written in the Quran:

""Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging.
Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot (alaqah), and We made the clot into a lump (mudghah), and We made the lump bones, and We clothed the bones with flesh‚Ä¶‚Äù


It's nonsense because:

Order is wrong: flesh doesn‚Äôt come after bones ‚Äî they develop simultaneously.

Alaqah doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúleech-like‚Äù in 7th-century Arabic ‚Äî it means clot, hanging thing, or blood clot, which is scientifically incorrect.

No mention of ova (female egg), genetic inheritance, neural development, or miscarriage ‚Äî all known in modern embryology.

Quran absolutely speaks opposite and unrelated to embryology. (Lol)

Every single line in Quran is absurd and anyone with decent education can catch that.

By claiming things about Jesus and defining a vague term like ""Islam which means submission to God"", Jesus won't become an Islamic figure. 

Just like if I define a vague term like ""Chuzlam"" which means any person who eats food then every food-eater won't become a follower of my religion. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

If I write a book tomorrow and claim that my book is the book which talks about Jesus and Jesus worshipped my God and he was a prophet. Will it become true? There is NO EVIDENCE of anything Islamic before Mohammad made up stories 600 years after Jesus died.

Haahahahahahahahaha! 

Mr. Zakir Naik junior. This is how Zakir Naik used to fool innocent people right? 

It doesn't matter if ""Islam means submission to the will of God"" because that ""God"" is not the God of your Quran aka Allah. 

Every single line of the Quran is false and fake and that has been proven multiple times. Any decently educated person can prove it and will laugh at it.

Your Quran claims that humanity started from a guy named Adam which is basically a story which Muhammad stole from the previous stories of Abrahamic religions.

The reality is that humanity evolved from Apes, Monkeys, and Mammals. 

Your Quran claims that earth was created in 6 days. Haahhahhahhaaha. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

The reality is it took billions of years for earth to be created. 

I am an engineer and don't even get me started on Big Bang Theory as your Quran doesn't even contain a word related to it. It was just crap made up by people like Zakir Naik to fool under-educated people.

Those people who Muhammad called as prophets by his vague definition of the word ""Islam"" were not prophets. 

Jesus Christ was a Jewish rabbi who serves as the God of Christianity. He had nothing to do with Islam.

I will create a vague word called ""Buzlam"" which means taking a bath just like your vague word ""Islam"" which means ""submission to the will of God"" then will any person taking a bath become my follower and I will become his ""prophet"". Hahahahahahahaahhaah ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

I not only REFUTED every single thing you claimed but I disproved that you were simply speaking nonsense by reading from random Islamic sites.

You‚Äôre quoting a metaphorical ‚Äòday‚Äô and trying to turn it into a precise scientific unit. That‚Äôs numerology, not evidence. The Qur‚Äôan doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äòthe Earth is 4.5 billion years old‚Äô or define ‚Äòyawm‚Äô as 2.3 billion years. You‚Äôre just making the numbers fit after the fact. Show me a single Muslim ""scholar"" before NASA who ever said this ratio. You can‚Äôt‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs a modern back fit, not a miracle.

This is called FRAUD and DECEPTION which can be done with ANY book. 

Let me show you how:

Harry Potter was born July 31, 1980

First book published June 26, 1997

Gap = 6,186 days

Divide by 365.25 = ~16.93 years


Now compare:

The Big Bang was ~13.8 billion years ago.

Earth ~4.54 billion years ago.

4.54 / 13.8 = 0.33

1 / 3 = 0.333...

16.93 is exactly half of 33.86 ü§Ø

Now should I say that Harry Potter is the Prophet of ""Allah""

J.K. Rowling (Harry Potter's author) encoded the ratio of Earth‚Äôs age to the universe ‚Äî just like the Qur‚Äôan supposedly did!

Did you see what I did here? This is what your Islamic ""scholars"" do.

Every single story book is written in a Metaphorical language from Harry Potter to The Jungle Book.

So you are accepting that the Quran is nothing but a story book? 

Your Islamic ""scholars"" are paid money by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc to lie and fool under-educated people who cannot catch their fraud and when they are caught they run like Zakir Naik did or Dr. Keith Moore did. 

Yes, it's fine that in the 7th century exact terms like Cell division, blastocyst, zygote did not exist. I know that but your Quran fails in giving indications as well. It tells exactly opposite things as well as incomplete things. 

Your Quran says:

Clot ‚Üí Lump ‚Üí Bones ‚Üí Flesh

But in reality:

Flesh and bones develop simultaneously.

Muscle and cartilage tissues develop in parallel, not one after the other.

The muscle tissue doesn‚Äôt ""cover"" bare bones as described in the verse.

Your, Quran is opposite and misses the most important thing WOMEN. It omits the fact that fertilization doesn‚Äôt happen from a ""drop of sperm"" alone ‚Äî it‚Äôs a single sperm fertilizing a female egg (ovum).

The Quran never mentions the ovum or female contribution, which is biologically essential.

Moreover, your last point is WRONG and a lie made up by Islamic ""scholars"". 

Muhammad was NOT illiterate. 

He was a warlord and a very cunning man. The claim that Muhammad was illiterate is based on:

Qur‚Äôan 7:157‚Äì158, which calls him ‚Äúan-Nabiy al-Ummi‚Äù (the unlettered prophet).

In classical Arabic, ‚ÄúUmmi‚Äù often meant non-Jewish or non-Scriptured, i.e., Gentile ‚Äî not someone who couldn't read.
It's your later Islamic ""scholars"" who reinterpret these words and say that ‚ÄúUmmi‚Äù = from ‚Äúumm‚Äù (mother) ‚Üí i.e., uneducated like from-the-womb.

That‚Äôs a lie made up by Islamic ""scholars"" after Muhammad. 

Here is the proof that Muhammad was not only well-literate but he was a very cunning man:


1.Muhammad drafted and signed the Constitution of Medina ‚Äî a formal legal charter involving dozens of tribes

2.Muhammad sent dozens of diplomatic letters to emperors, governors, etc.

3. Muhammad created treaties, such as Hudaybiyyah, negotiated line-by-line

This PROVES that he was not illiterate.",1,1743856466.0,False

I cannot believe the garbage I have just read. How can someone even type what you have typed? Did you put your mind to rest when you were typing it? The absurdity of your comments really annoy me. I hope you are not simply copy-pasting from online Islamic blogs and Dawah Sites because they are just garbage articles written by Muslim propagandists in a self-attested way without any counter questioning. They get paid money by countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, etc to write that bullshit and they always get exposed later and then they run.

Dr. Keith Moore was slammed by his own colleagues like PZ Myers for his ridiculous claims when he took money from Saudi Arabia to lie about Embryo formation in Quran. He was slammed by the University of California for lying. 

As, I have mentioned in my previous comments there are ZERO indications of anything scientific or even anything logical in Quran whether related to the Universe or whether Embryos.

As, a matter of fact Quran mentions everything OPPOSITE and CONTRARY to science. 

Here is how:

**1. Embryo formation:**

**‚ÄúWe created man from a drop of sperm, then We made him a clinging clot (*****alaqah*****), then We made the clot into a lump (*****mudghah*****), then We made the lump bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh...‚Äù**  
‚Äî *Surah Al-Mu‚Äôminun (23:13-14)*

This is bullshit. It claims opposite of what actually happens.

The Sequence is Biologically Incorrect

The verse says:

Clot ‚Üí Lump ‚Üí Bones ‚Üí Flesh

**But in reality:**

Flesh and bones develop simultaneously.

Muscle and cartilage tissues develop in parallel, not one after the other.

The muscle tissue doesn‚Äôt ""cover"" bare bones as described in the verse.

**Scientific problem:** This is not how embryonic development works at all

Fertilization doesn‚Äôt happen from a ""drop of sperm"" alone ‚Äî it‚Äôs a single sperm fertilizing a female egg (ovum).

Quran never mentions the ovum or female contribution, which is scientifically essential.

**Scientific problem: The Quran describes reproduction as male-centric, which reflects ancient Greek or pre-modern embryology, not modern science.**

Missing from the Quran:

Ovum / egg

Uterus / womb wall implantation details

Cell division, blastocyst, zygote

Germ layers, neural tube, organ development

Any precise timelines or stages (which modern embryology is based on)

**Scientific problem:** The Quran‚Äôs description is vague, metaphorical, and lacks anatomical accuracy.

  
2. **Universe**:

I'm laughing while I even type this. Hahahahahahahahaha. 

The Quran never states the age of the Earth or universe

It never gives a number of years for anything. No mention of 13.8 billion or 4.54 billion or even ""billions."" There‚Äôs no claim in the Quran that these ‚Äúdays‚Äù are proportionally tied to modern time. It ignores billions of years of detail, including the formation of stars, galaxies, solar systems, etc. Any random ratio (1/2, 1/4, 2/5) can be retrofitted to some scientific number. The Quranic language is metaphorical, theological, not quantitative science. So any claim of a match is always post hoc reinterpretation.

There is already enough CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE  of the existence of Lord Krishna and after the excavations are complete we will have the PRIMARY EVIDENCE as well.

Current, archeological evidence is:

There was a significant ancient port city at or near the location of modern Dwarka.

The submergence of the city due to rising sea levels or tectonic activity is real, as described in texts.

This is only a half-truth. For Islam divides as inexorably as it binds. Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity. The second defect of Islam is that it is a systemof social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. To the Muslim ibi bene ibi patria \[Where it is well with me, there is my country\] is unthinkable. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin.‚Äù***  This is from Ambedkar's book ""Partition of India"".

The AQI scale typically categorizes values as follows:

Good (0-50): Air quality is satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.

Moderate (51-100): Air quality is acceptable; however, some pollutants may pose a moderate health concern for a small number of sensitive individuals.

Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups (101-150): Sensitive groups may experience health effects, while the general public is less likely to be affected.

Unhealthy (151-200): Everyone may begin to experience health effects; sensitive groups may experience more serious effects.

Very Unhealthy (201-300): Health alert: everyone may experience more serious health effects.

Hazardous (301 and above): Health warning of emergency conditions: the entire population is more likely to be affected.


Based on data from 2024, the countries with the highest average AQI values, indicating poor air quality, are as follows:

1. Bangladesh: Average AQI of 140, with monthly averages ranging from 244 in January to 32 in December.


2. Pakistan: Average AQI of 115, with monthly averages fluctuating between 200 in January and 62 in December.

However, some areas are generally known for having better air quality than others:

1. Himalayan Region: Cities like Shimla, Manali, and Darjeeling tend to have relatively cleaner air, as they are located in the hills with less industrial activity and lower population densities.


2. Coastal Areas: Coastal cities like Goa, Kochi, and parts of Kerala often have better air quality due to the natural breezes from the sea, which help in dispersing pollutants.


3. Smaller Cities and Towns: Smaller cities and towns away from major industrial centers tend to have better air quality. Examples include Udaipur in Rajasthan and Mysore in Karnataka.


4. Northeastern States: States like Sikkim and Nagaland have relatively good air quality because of lower levels of urbanization and industrialization.

Yes. It was necessary. 

Sati--- It started when invaders invaded India. And they practiced necro --   phile. So it was compulsion. Not self made decision. They fought for generations. And their women did it for generations. So new gen thought of it as religious  practice. They didn't had the time to educate new ones why it was happening. They were busy in fighting. 


Dowry -- yes it is also wrong. In weddings family members used to gift gold and money to bride. Since they couldn't give her land. And they did it willingly and had choice. But today it is compulsion rather than gift. Both sides are wrong. Man - demanding dowry, woman - prioritising job over everything else. If a man have enough money to feed his family and have good qualities. And have enough money to give his children quality education. That it is all anyone needs. Vice vera for women. 


Also it isn't written anywhere that women can't work. Women can work and men can take care of house. But it depends on both parties. Generally image of working women is bad. Especially in certain professions. That's why it is happening. But if we normalise it (working of women) than women will have same right in those professions and if one is bad then other would demand that it is wrong. Because man can't demand this. It would be seem like discrimination against sx. So to get in higher position some are using their body instead of work.

And it wasn't outlawed by british. It was opposed by many indians. British weren't some saints. They were like "" see they practice such practices, they aren't human, they must be ruled. (behind the scenes - go and fetch me some girls and kotha was established to please their military, there was nothing like that before.

India isn‚Äôt your typical country, it‚Äôs more like the European Union in disguise. Every region has its own language, culture, and history that's older than half the civilizations we read about in textbooks.

As a Telugu-speaking guy, let me be clear I'm totally against this nonsense of bullying people for not knowing a local language. Nobody‚Äôs obligated to learn a new tongue just to visit a place. But when we decided to divide the country into states based on language, the least we can do is respect the language of the land. That‚Äôs just basic decency.

The real mess began when the central government started pushing Hindi as the ""national"" language. Favoring one language over others in a multilingual country is a surefire way to breed resentment. You can‚Äôt sideline people‚Äôs identities and expect them to clap for it.

Take few central government exams, for instance offered only in Hindi and English. That‚Äôs a clear advantage for native Hindi speakers. Meanwhile, non-Hindi folks are stuck choosing between two languages that aren‚Äôt their own. How‚Äôs that fair? Equality means equal footing right? It's like forcing people to climb an extra hill just to compete.

My Take? 

Make English the sole official language. Nobody owns it, nobody will go against it and ironically, everyone wants it.

Even those fools who are doing language politics and those fools who are supporting the Hindi as national language want their kids in a ENGLISH-MEDIUM schools. 

Let‚Äôs stop pretending and just be practical.",1,1743787669.0,False

The rents in Mumbai or Pune are so high because of the demand which is propped up by outsiders. Folks not speaking kannada in Bengaluru would completely make the language extinct because it would make the natives in places like shivamogga or Kalaburgu forget the language.

If you can't communicate with the majority of people in the area that you are, you are fundamentally missing the point of having linguistic capabilities in the first place, and you should learn the language that is needed so you can communicate. In the context of inter-India migration, I am strictly in the camp that if you stay in a new place for even 1 year, you should have learned to speak in that places majority language (at least basic phrases/ day-to-day stuff). If more than 5 years, you should be passibly fluent. It's super hard to learn new languages, but with proper help from the natives, it is possible. 

That being said, in the contect of this post, oftentimes what is missed when people are sayig ""language is culture"" is that while yes, language is part of culture, sometimes sacrifices have to be made for a greater union. Take China for example -- they nearly obliterated their local regional languages, or made them have second-tier status, and all people had to learn Mandarin. This, in the long run reduced inefficiencies in the system now that all 1.4 billion people can somewhat communicate with each other without barriers. Most importantly, it enhanced a collective country identity. In India, considering the fraught nature of the North/South conversation, English would work as a language for that as something from outside the subcontinent. 

The national language question is irrelevant. The real question is do people really want to be part of the idea of an ""Indian"" country. If they do, sacrifices should have been made to make us all have one language, even if it was the language was of the former colonial overlords, English. Simply put, efficiency over feelings. If no Indian language is acceptable to all Indians, then pick any language not from India. Even if it erases all the culture you have. The goal is all that matters. 

If the idea was to keep a EU-style coalition, then everyone can do whatever they want, no need for a single communication language, no need for optimizing the language. 

People go on and on about imposition, identity, culture etc. All that is irrelevant. India suffers from this stupid discussion because it can't decide whether it wants to operate as a unit or not, and even worse, those that decide one way or another lack the fortitude to make the sacrifices needed to make it become a reality.",1,1743893157.0,False

Our fresher's team had a lady - married woman - who due to personal reasons joined the workforce later in life. 

Both these managers hit on her knowing that she's married and also knowing that she knows they're both married with kids. Their dialogues included, ""You're so young to handle marital life""; ""We two are there for you if you need anything. Don't bother others""; ""Your husband is a very lucky man"" etc.

This poor lady came to me and my friends, requesting to speak to the leader and inform the managers about the discomfort that she had to endure. We were new but we told this to our leader. What happened after that, we both are unaware of it. But within a month, that lady left the job.

Do yoga or meditation. Read Swami Vivekanand or something. 

No need to open your zipper when a younger colleague passes by. Their faulty marriages do not give them any leeway at all to act in such an unacceptable behaviour. 

And there's considerable risk too. Not legal.

-how to save and basically invest money

-what I wanted to study,

-What places to avoid bad people who would put me I'm the harms way

-how to gauge someone's feelings, identifying your own emotions and taking a steps to get out of said negative emotions.

All these imply that a person has good clarity towards their own life. My friends and many women are getting married now at 25-26 with their partners of 5 years. This points to the fact that women even in their early 20s have the clarity to seek out exactly what they want.

Yes it's not rocket science to figure these things out. But I asked for your POV on the matter because when a person makes a generalized statement, they should be able to substantiate it with some form of supporting statement, even if it is anecdotal.

Do muslims vote for bjp? Negligible we can take them out completely 

Christians? Maybe in Kerala there's a reason why Suresh Gopi won but even their population is negligible 

Other minorities are either regional or too negligible 

That leaves hindus 

Hindu voters of bjp aren't secular alot of them have prejudice against muslims in their minds anyways all they need is some media justification of things like waqf amendment UCC NRC CAA and they will be ready to support bjp 

Meanwhile the other swing voters aren't too large but c'mon the reason they vote bjp is cuz of 2 reasons

1) hate the other options
2) they support policies  like UCC NRC CAA

Now while all this happened privately, Sheikh Hasina opened about it to the media, not directly calling out the US but terming them as an 'external force wanting to break up BD'. While everything went normal for the next few months, the CIA and Pakistan(ISIS)(probably these 2 entities) caused widespread protests under the banner of injustice against the students there(this protest was against some twisted law about 100% reservation in universities given to the kin of war heroes but the anti-government forces basically rode this wave to destabilise the government).

Another point is that he is a good captain but not as good as dhoni(In Test Kohli was the best). Bad point about his captaincy is that when things go against him he becomes clueless and sometimes unnecessarily he is extra defensive. 2023 world cup loss was partly due to his captaincy. When the spinners were bowling guy did not put a slip. I remember travis and marnus both edging once and no slip.

Rcb is a colossal failure of team as they have even struggled put out a squad that u would say were the favourites of winning the tournament look at the team now after a very long while they have a balanced team and even in this iteration I cannot confidently say they will make playoffs as there are holes almost in every second  department and is one dimensional players clubbed together making them more vulnerable, heck we literally saw that against Gt.

Although as a corporate franchise they have been lit, the social media game has been of the charts for atleast a decade, they were literally ahead of the funny sketches by a decade maybe and the unboxing events omg they are good at maintaining that traction, although  rcb got very very lucky that they got Kohli and Kohli turned out the way he did otherwise who knows but even than let‚Äôs say if Punjab had Kohli than I don‚Äôt see them being this popular and relevant atleast online they have been immaculate in harnessing Kohli‚Äôs fame probably the best.

1. A poor batsman who only scored in subcontinent pitches. His test average of 37/38 shows ....his poor technique got exposed in the actual format of the game. Dhoni has NO CENTURIES OUTSIDE SUBCONTINENT. A flat track bully.

2. Dropped Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly, two of the batting greats from Indian squad in 2008 before tri series in Australia. Mind you ...Dada was 5th  highest ODI run getter in 2007 and 3rd highest in India just after Yuvi and Sachin Paji.  And while Rahul Dravid, our dear jammy was not having a  great time ...he still would score a 30 or 40 in middle order at a good strike rate. Dhoni went to say to selectors that Dada and Jammy weren't good fielders and getting old. But he  himself played upto age of 38 in 2019 WC. Hypocrisy!!!

3. Any fan who watches cricket and understands the game will say that Adam Gilchrist and Sangakkara were better wicket keeper batsmen than Dhoni. Specially Gilly. Used to bat in lower middle order....till had test batting average of 47.60 in tests. A gem üíé. 

4. Anyone remembers Yuvraj Singh for being man of the series in 2011 WC ? Or the GOAT Sachin Tendulkar for being highest run scorers for India ? The media hyped only Dhoni's knock of 91 at final ...made him a hero and forgot GG's 97.",5,1743863391.0,False

And after every such match, someone from CSK gives a statement about his injury to cover up his subpar batting performance.

Where does the injury disappear when he is keeping? As far as a knee injury is concerned, wicket keeping is a far more strenuous activity for the legs. Just look at the complete process of keeping. The keeper has to squat down before each ball is delivered. 8-10 overs are bowled by spinners so the squat position is even deeper. Then after every ball is bowled, the keeper has to go to the wicket to collect the ball again. And between all this process the keeper takes care of the catches, stumpings, stopping occasional bad balls.

How is all this less strenuous to his knees than coming out to bat and do some powerhitting? The injury is just an excuse to cover up his batting failures now. Just a shitshow from his PR, CSK management and whoever else is involved in this money making scheme by keeping him in the team.",18,1743860870.0,False

In an ideal world i would have preferred all of them to ditch ipl for this season and play county to get used to english conditions but money comes first. Delhi has 2 FC matches before england tour, so Virat should definitely try to get his mojo and confidence back by scoring big, i would even go as far as to say that he should open for Delhi to try to play with the new ball as much as possible since balls swings for a longer duration in England and batting at 4th in Indians conditions will not prepare him at all. Same for Rohit, he should also try to play ranji. The problem with Indian players is that our board does not allow or give them time to play in foreign leagues to get better used to their conditions. All the top players of the world have been playing in IPL for over 10 years, making them ready for subcontinent conditions.

Add to the fact that some of those campaigns started with 4-5 losses in the beginning and to make a comeback post that you obviously need a good leader and pretty good team environment.

Bowling choices were actually pretty decent by Pandya. Chahar bowled that second over really poorly. Bowling another over of his to 2 right handers at that point would be dumb, so he brought leftie Ashwani who actually bowled a terrific first over. His second over was pretty bad, but it happens to a young player playing just his second game of career. It was his first bad over yet since his debut.

Sort of agree that bawa choice was weird. But that was a temporary thing. Rohit is probably gonna be back next game. So just for the sake of it an extra all rounder was added‚Ä¶ which is fine. With all pacers except Hardik himself being hit badly, introducing bawa to bowling could be very risky. He should have batted ahead of santner though.

Hardik was probably the best bowler among both teams yesterday, what are you on. And he batted ‚Äúfine‚Äù just there was too much left to be done. The Dhoni strategy of leaving 3 over 40-45 to win every game doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Bowlers are smarter now. 

Tilaks batting the last 2 games is really really unlike him. So it‚Äôs very unexpected. Was almost  Yuvraj in 2014 final kind of innings. Happens sometimes. In hindsight we always think, why didn‚Äôt he try to slog and get out. 

There weren‚Äôt any ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù on youngsters. In fact we now have 2 exciting youngsters in the team. As backup for 2 international players in those spots: Bumrah and Allah Ghaznfar. 

It‚Äôs bad luck that mi is the only team who is missing their best player. Imagine Lsg without pooran, kkr without Narine, Punjab without Shreyas and so on.

CSK‚Äôs Decline Is Not An Aberration Anymore

LIKE all of you I‚Äôm a massive fan of THALA DHONI & CSK from year 1 & will be for a lifetime.

However, outside of fandom, If I see objectively this is the worst CSK XI that has played in terms of batting line up. 

CSK used to be a home of swashbuckling openers like HAYDEN, WATSON, HUSSEY, VIJAY, PARTHIV etc

That opening combination is missing very badly. We had the most solid 3 & 4 in RAINA & BADRINATH & then RAYADU this middle order compared to that is very very fragile.

RUTURAJ as a leader lacks confidence leave aside that he not added value as a batsman this time & why he moved to no.3 is out of my mind.

Spinning combo of ASH & JADDU not that brutal anymore. NOOR is more relied upon. 

MSD is not that finisher who can turn the match on his head everyday.

I see the signs of a very bad season in 2025. I may be wrong üòë and will be happy if proven wrong but this team doesn‚Äôt going to playoffs IMO. 

We need a total rehaul, MSD as mentor, bring new coach & leave old guards now bring in new players fresh mindsets & that is the only way our legacy will survive.

This may hurt many CSK fans & me also but I think time has come up not to SUGARCOAT things anymore.

Forget about Rohit Sharma for a moment. What message does that send to Bumrah and Surya - the best T20 bowler and batsman respectively in India? What happens to their captaincy ambitions? What happens to their brand value? What happens to their team loyalty? Given the price top Indian stars earn, it won't be extreme to think that some team will be willing to shell out 40 crores for Bumrah or 35 crores for Surya along with captaincy offer. How will you keep your biggest match winners motivated in such a scenario? Performances are bound to suffer in such environments. 

And to top it all, Hardik is way too arrogant and egoistic. He takes the new ball ahead of Bumrah and Archer, retires out Tilak Varma, discards MI home grown talents like Madhwal and Wadhera. Basically he is doing exactly the opposite of what MI has been known for all these years, i.e., backing the team and unknown youngsters. e.g., If Hardik Pandya of 2025 was the Captain of MI in 2015, Hardik Pandya and Bumrah wouldn't have grown to be the great players that they are today.",23,1743846099.0,False

Of course as a child and early to mid teens we were dia hard fans of Sachin. But only afterwards I came to understand the immense impact Dravid and Laxman made in Tests.

They were big moment players and rescued and even won India games too many times to count, against Strong teams of that era. 

VVS had a special liking against Australia. When the whole world was shitting against Australia bowling, VVS used to score against them for fun. And for that reason he was nicknamed Very Very Special. Cause of course you are special if you treat Aussies bowlers like McGrath, Warne, Lee and Gillespie like -  a Club level bowlers.

Dravid, oh my God..Dravid.. He was Mr dependable.  The more and more I got immersed in Tests, the more respect I started to have for him. The guy was named the Wall, not for nothing. Super consistent and you could count on him to stay at the crease and hold the one end of the crease for an eternity. 

It's my personal unpopular opinion that post 2000..Dravid was a better , impactful, and clutch player than Sachin in Tests, just marginally better.

That kind of batting barely works these days but it was perfect during that period. And Dravid was the absolute best in that.

IndiaCricket,1jsdvpr,New Cricket Fan Here :- Why do Indians think Rahul Dravid was one of the best test batsmen ever ?,mloau5h,t1_mlo9cn7,thetechiestrikes,"You're complaining Abt his stats against Australia??

Dravid scored 600 plus runs in a series once in 2003/04 series vs Australia & in 2002 series vs England. Sachin never scored 500 runs in any series.

Here's some more food for your thoughts.

Rahul Dravid had a long stay at the top of ICC Test rankings with a highest rating of 892 points in March 2005. He spent 35 Tests and 226 days as No 1 batsman in ICC rankings.

Dravid averaged above 58 for 16 tests but Sachin had that average for 4 tests only.

Dravid scored 3 centuries in a series twice in 2002 & in 2011 vs England. Sachin never had 3 tons in a series.

Rahul Dravid took part in winning team whenever India won away test from Apr 1994 to March 2014 (20 seasons) & had an Indian record for most wins (24) abroad in his 16 years career.

Sachin took part in 20 away test wins in his long career of 24 years.

Dravid scored two centuries in a test twice, once saved match vs NZ and once winning vs Pakistan. Sachin never achieved it.

Dravid had scored minimum a test century in a calendar year from 97 to 2011 means 15 consecutive years. Sachin didn't had such record.


If you go through their PROGRESSIVE TEST careers you can find Sachin on top hand in 2 occasions only to Dravid 162 occasions.

And more over cricket is not about records because it's a team game. So partnerships are very important to win a match & for the reason Dravid is no.1 in this team game. I don't want it necessary to quote records regarding his part in winning. Dravid had 6 triple century partnerships in international cricket one more than Bradman.

Dravid was not an extraordinary stroke maker like Sachin. But he had the ability to bat on and on and frustrate the bowlers to no end. These qualities are very essential in test cricket. Additionally Dravid had the additional quality of dispatching loose balls to the boundary and rotating the strike and building partnerships. Also Dravid did not lose heart when the situation was dire and other batsmen found it difficult to score. He was there like a rock and somehow saw to it that his team either wins or at least draws the match. You are not gonna find this stuff in espn cricinfo stats guru numbers.

Because of these qualities he saw to it that India won many matches when defeat was staring at its face.

Because of qualities like grit and determination, to defend patiently and forge partnerships and see to it that India wins many people consider Dravid superior to Sachin in tests.",1,1743931266.0,False

For me i worshipped sachin because of my father he introduced me to cricket and he used to watch every match of india. He gifted me t shirt of sachin with master blaster written on it.

Later when i grew up and after sachin retired dhoni was the one guy who i absolutely trusted to flip the match result. 
I used to say ""abhi to dhoni crease pe hai""

Then comes the virat and i fell in love with the game truly.

There was no hate to dhoni before only after the new generation came new people started to hate dhoni because they haven't seen dhoni much and their idol was virat so they hated the next person who was the same or arguebly more adored by indians.

They couldn't do that to sachin as he has an unmatched legacy and literally called a god in cricket for a reason.

It's all just new generation Who is unable to embrace both players at the same time. They just had to pick a side.

Firstly why aren't the support staffs or analysts of your beloved team not able to catch something so blatant? Like what sort of fools do you have in your dugout? Are the teams in on it? So they have conveyed their players to not raise such concerns? If that's the case why are unsold players silent with this sort of juicy revelation with them?

Secondly, one thing I have heard very commonly is that he starts chucking after getting hit for a boundary. But he isn't getting caught anyways. Like this is 5th season after he has been cleared off. So why not chuck from the first ball itself. Make it harder for batters to hit him at all.

And lastly, are we going to say that redditors here know cricket better than Rahul Dravid and Javagal Srinath. Who cleared off his action the last time when it was put under scanner. Mind you this is the same Rahul Dravid who has story of about how he could tell his bat's weight was off by a few grams.

In His batting however he was chucking a lot of sixes which helped KKR set up the match to go big in the final 10 overs, ultimately aiding them to win the match.The other 4 bowlers who took 18+ wickets and VA‚Äôs 11 wickets did contribute a lot to KKR winning the trophy as well, same goes for previous titles won by KKR.

You also have to factor in the 15 degree leeway and the arm can be bent before it reaches the shoulder level, after reaching shoulder level if the forearm is not rotated by 15 degrees, then that‚Äôs legal as well.If the arm remains bent after it reaches shoulder level, then that‚Äôs fine as well.Due to biomechanics most bowlers offer some amount of chucking, but it is within the 15 degree leeway or 15 degrees.

For example if rotation angle of the arm is 45 degrees at shoulder level then the  angle cannot be less than 30 degrees at the point of release.No matter how much you bend the arm or twitch while bowling, if the angle is not more than 15 degrees, then it is legal.

For further reasoning I suggest you look up clips from 2012-2014 and then compare them to now.The amount of turn he got in that period made him unplayable.He used to turn the ball from middle stump to almost near the wide line.The amount of turn he extracts now is normal with comparison to other bowlers.I believe after he changed his action, the angle of straightening after the bend became less than 15 degrees and within ICC limits.If you don‚Äôt allow 15 degrees of leeway then Muttiah Muralitharan‚Äôs action was also illegal.",-16,1743765374.0,True

Bent elbow. Rashid Khan is a chucker. Want me to start capturing such stills of others as well?

Serious ""Reddit we caught him"" energy there my friend.

That post is by Rahul Dravid? Because he cleared off Narine last time.

[https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2020-sunil-narine-s-action-cleared-off-suspect-action-warning-list-1236367](https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/ipl-2020-sunil-narine-s-action-cleared-off-suspect-action-warning-list-1236367)

So all you need is me to post about Warner using sandpaper to roughen up the ball which helped SRH to the title in 2016 and you would lap it up?

Or how about another theory for your beloved RCB. Hazlewood is freaking tampering with the ball. Economy jumped from 8.5 to 13+ in the previous game as soon as the ball was changed mid innings. And just let me add up some stills of people hovering around Kohli so he can discreetly get rid of the sandpaper while acting to get injured.

Exactly. But they are valid in the same vein that this is. Because this is something pulled out of the ass just like those 2. So stop taking a freaking moral high ground and bring in some logical points rather than I can see it with my eyes so it's indeed true sort of logic. And I can back them. Look at SRH opposition scores in 2016, want me to write them up? And look at Hazlewood's performance from previous match before and after the ball change. That's the sort of proof you are accepting in case of Narine. So either accept all of them or none of them. My conspiracy theory is better than yours doesn't work as a definitive proof you know.

Those stills of Narine also aren't just at the release. They are random stills from his bowling, same as Rashid's. I am not claiming Rashid to be a chucker. I am just showing how it looks using random stills. I can produce same sort of stills for others as well.",3,1743773920.0,False

I mean Indian team also got all out for 36 and recently for 46 in India.

Does that discredit the entire brilliance and records of our batters?

The post is talking about how these 3 were destructive in the past which is right.

Ask SRH also who would they pick between prime Gayle, Koach and ABD or prime Head, Abhishek and Klassen and you will get the answer.



>esides SRH today is factually more destructive

This is true without a doubt. This is exactly the entire issue with RCB that they never had anyone firm besides these 3 and Chahal in bowling.

SRH 2024 was a great combination of both batting and bowling.

and even as a RCB fan I don't why such posts are even allowed on this sub. If the post is specifically saying these 3 were dangerous it's absolutely true if it says the RCB was destructive then it's wrong.

But bringing 49 all out or how RCB hasn't won any trophy is just not logical. 

We Indians fans should understand this better because we all saw how even after having a great team with legends of the game playing together sometimes you just fail to win.
